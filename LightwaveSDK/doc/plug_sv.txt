1    Plug-In Interface

There are two parts to the system-generic plug-in interface: the host
side and the server side.  The host is the application program which
wants to load external code modules to perform some generic type of
operation.  Servers are imported routines (which can be loaded
plug-ins or internal built-ins) which implement a specific instance of
a generic type of service.

The host interface provides facilities to create server classes,
register plug-in modules, and perform lazy loading and activation of
registered servers.  There is a fairly elaborate name and type mapping
scheme which allows a great deal of flexibility in how modules are
used, but which still provides a fairly simple interface for those who
do not need the full facility.

The server interface provides an easy method to write programs that
will operate as plug-ins.  Different classes of plug-in services will
require different host interfaces, but the loading and initialization
part of the server interface is standard and works with the host
portion of the system.


1.1    Server Identification

The plug-in interface is designed to allow the host to have any number
of servers loaded to perform as many different functions as the host
wants to define.  The servers in the system are referenced by a
combination of class and name.

A Server Class is a string which determines the type of service which
the server can perform.  This might be strings like "TEXTURE" or
"FileRequester".  Many servers can have the same class, and all
servers of the same class have the same host interface.

A Server Name is a string which refers to a specific server within a
given class.  This might be something like "FractalNoise3D" or
"Default".  The name must be unique among the servers of the same
class.

The names for class and server identification should be byte strings
containing characters only the the ASCII range 33-127.  By convention
these string contain no spaces and no characters outside 7-bit ASCII.
Case is significant in distinguishing different classes and servers
within classes.


1.2    Server Activation Function

Every server has a single `activation' function.  This is the function
which the host calls to access the service provided by the server.
For some servers this one function will perform the whole action and
for others this will only be a prelude to a sequence of actions.
Servers which must remain loaded after they return from their
activation function must be locked by the host while there are actions
pending or they may be unloaded.


1.3    The Global Function

The activation function for every server is called with a `global'
function pointer which provides access to the internal global state of
the host system.  The server calls the function with a string
identifing the global data requested and a flag for how it will be
used.  The host can service this request, or the request can be passed
on to global plug-in servers.


1.4    Plug-in and Built-in Servers

Servers can be either plug-in or built-in.  A plug-in server is
implemented as a file containing code that can be loaded and unloaded
as needed.  A built-in server is implemented as a callback within the
host itself.  Having both allows the host to provide a standard set of
servers which it handles the same way it handles plug-in servers,
without having to unbundle their functionality in a way that can be
replaced or used by other programs.


2    Server Interface

A plug-in server is written like any ordinary C program, but instead
of a single "main()" entry point, a server has a different primary
entry point and several possible additional entry points.  The server
is linked with initializaion code (different from the normal shell or
Workbench init) which places these interfaces where the host can
access them.

There are two main types of plug-in modules: those providing a single
server and those providing multiple servers.  It is simple to have one
server per module, but it can be more efficient and useful to define
many servers with a single code file.

All servers require an activation function, and all plug-ins have the
option of providing initialization and cleanup functions.  The header
for server types is `splug.h'.


2.1    Plug-in Initialization and Cleanup

In both the single and multiple versions of the plug-in module, there
are optional entry points which allow the module to initialize itself
when it is first loaded and to clean itself up before being unloaded.
If the plug-in code does not contain functions with these names, no
attempt will be made to call them.

The Startup function, if present, will be called when the plug-in is
first loaded into the host system.  The return value is global data
for the server which is passed to the Activate and Shutdown entry
points as ` serverData'.  A zero return value (null pointer) indicates
failure, so even a plug-in with no data should return something.

    (1)  Startup usage

		void *
	Startup (void)

If provided, the server's Shutdown function is called just before the
server module is unloaded from the host.  Any allocated server data
should be freed at this point.  Note that even though it is an error,
this function may be called even when the server is locked, so correct
cleanup should be done in this case as well.

    (2)  Shutdown usage

		void
	Shutdown (
		void                    *serverData)


2.2    Activation Function

All servers have a single activation function which is the entry point
for the host to get access to the service provided by the server.  The
activation function gets passed the version number for the service
implementation, the `global' pointer to access global host data,
class-specific `local' data, and private data maintained by the
plug-in.  The version number is application-defined, but typically it
represents the revision of the interface that the host expects the
server to use.  Typically a server will not attempt to operate if the
version number is greater than it expects.  The ` serverData' is
returned by the Startup entry point in a plug-in.  The global function
can be called to get global data from the host enviroment, and the
contents of the `local' pointer are defined by the type of service.

    (3)  Activation function args

	long             version,
	GlobalFunc      *global,
	void            *local,
	void            *serverData

The activation function returns an error code if the attempt to call
failed because of some clash between the server and the host
environment.  If the server was able to process the request, even it
failed to complete it, it should return AFUNC_OK.  If the version
number is not a value which the server can explicitly handle it should
return AFUNC_BADVERSION.  If there is some global data the server
cannot get which it requires it should return AFUNC_BADGLOBAL.  Severe
problems with the contents of the local data, such as some necessary
pointer in the local data being null, may be reported by returning
AFUNC_BADLOCAL.  AFUNC_BADAPP is returned if the server detects an
application under which it chooses not to function; plug-ins can use
this to lock themselves into (or out of) specific LightWave-based
application derivatives (i.e., Inspire 3D).  Any other errors from the
server (running out of memory, bad filenames, user aborts, etc.) must
be provided for by the specific plug-in protocol.

    (4)  ActivateFunc type

	typedef int     ActivateFunc (<Activation function args>);

	#define AFUNC_OK                0
	#define AFUNC_BADVERSION        1
	#define AFUNC_BADGLOBAL         2
	#define AFUNC_BADLOCAL          3
	#define AFUNC_BADAPP        4


2.3    Global Function

The global function passed by the host to the server is a special
function which returns the pointer to some global data given by a
string ID.  These data blocks will often contain function pointers,
but can be anything.

    (5)  GlobalFunc types

	typedef void *          GlobalFunc (const char *, int);
	. . .

When a server calls the global function, it passes a string which
identifies the global data required and a code for the way the data
will be used.  If the data pointer is not available, null is returned.
The ID's that will be recognized depends on the host, on the available
global plug-ins and perhaps on the server class.

The use code depends on how the result of the call will be used.  If
the returned pointer will only be used for the course of the
activation function itself, the TRANSIENT code should be used.  If the
data will be used after the activation function returns, such as in a
server that requires locking, the ACQUIRE code should be used.  In
this case there must be a matching RELEASE call made when the data
pointer is no longer required.  RELEASE calls need only be made for
ACQUIRE calls which returned a non-null pointer.  The return value
from a release mode global data call is undefined.

    (6)  GlobalFunc types
	. . .
	#define GFUSE_TRANSIENT         0
	#define GFUSE_ACQUIRE           1
	#define GFUSE_RELEASE           2


2.4    The Global Server Class

The server class given by the name "Global" is special in that it
allows multiple plug-in servers to share common data or routines.  In
fact, the members of the Gobal class are extensions to the set of ID
strings that can be passed to the "global" function.

When a server calls the global function with an ID string, the host
can service the request itself or has the option of pass unrecognized
ID's to Global class servers of the same name.  For example, if the ID
is "Mambo Functions," the host may recognize this itself and return a
pointer value.  If it does not recognize it, it may attempt to
activate a server of class "Global" with name "Mambo Functions." If
such a server exists, it may be locked or unlocked, depending on the
use type of the global request, and it will be called to get the value
of the global pointer for the orignal requester.

The activation function of a Global server is called with a
GlobalService structure which will be initialized with the ID string
for the request.  The server must fill in the data pointer with a
value which will be returned to the client, which may be null if the
server wishes to deny the request.  The string is passed as data so
that the same activation function may be used for multiple servers.

    (7)  Global activation data

	typedef struct st_GlobalService {
		const char      *id;
		void            *data;
	} GlobalService;


2.5    External Function Entry Points

Functions in the plug-in get called directly by the host, and this is
a funky thing in some systems since they are different environments.
The XCALL_ and XCALL_INIT macros take care of everything for all
different systems and compilers, so these can be used to make
multi-platform servers from a single source code.

XCALL_ is used on the return type, e.g.  XCALL_(int) for an external
entry point returning an int.  XCALL_INIT is used as the first
statement of the function.  Both must be used for full compatibility,
but XCALL_INIT is only non-null for Manx small-code modules.

    (8)  XCALL Definitions

	<XCALL_ and XCALL_INIT system-specific definition>

The activation function as well as any function pointers returned from
the activation function need the XCALL treatment.  Startup and
Shutdown do not.


2.6    Single-Service Plug-ins

A single-service plug-in is a C program with an entry point for the
activation callback and global symbols for the class and name of the
server.  There are also optional entry points for initialization and
cleanup.

This plug-in must contain a global character string with the name
`ServerClass'.  This string defines the class of this server and the
server will not be loaded if this string does not match the service
type string requested by the host.

It must also contain a global character string called `ServerName'
which holds the name for this specific server.

The activation function must be called Activate, which takes the
arguments as described above.

    (9)  Activate usage

		XCALL_(int)
	Activate (<Activation function args>)


2.7    Multiple-Service Plug-ins

A multiple-service plug-in is a C program which defines multiple
servers through a standard set of global symbols.  In particular, a
multiple server module must contain a global array with the name
`ServerDesc' composed of elements of the ServerRecord type.  The last
record in the array must have a null class name pointer.

    (10)  ServerRecord type

	typedef struct st_ServerRecord {
		const char      *className;
		const char      *name;
		ActivateFunc    *activate;
	} ServerRecord;

The plug-in module may also have Startup and Shutdown entry points,
and all the activate functions in the plug-in will get the same
serverData as returned from the Startup function.  The assumption is
that the servers all share a module for some logical reason, so the
sharing of global data is not unreasonable.


3    Common Globals

There are a few global data types which are so basic that they are the
same across plug-in hosts or are used in a wide range of plug-in
interfaces.


3.1    Host Display Info

A plug-in may need to open windows to get user input, and since they
run in the host's context, they will need to do this using the host's
display information.  This info, which can be normally accessed with
the "Host Display Info" ID string, contains information about the
windows and display context used by the host.  If this ID yeilds a
null pointer, the server is probably running in a batch mode and has
no display context.

The fields of the HostDisplayInfo structure vary from system to
system, but all include the window pointer is the main application
window or null if there is none.  On X systems, the window session
handle is passed.  On Win32 systems, the application instance is
provided, even though it is probably unnecessary.

    (11)  Host Display Info declaration

	typedef struct st_HostDisplayInfo {
	    #ifdef _XGL
		Display         *xsys;
		Window           window;
	    #endif

	    #ifdef _MACOS
		WindowPtr        window;
	    #endif

	    #ifdef _WIN32
		HANDLE           instance;
		HWND             window;
	    #endif
	} HostDisplayInfo;

This structure is defined in the `hdisp.h' header file.


3.2    Monitor Objects

Monitors are simple data structures defining an interface which the
server can use to give feedback to the host on its progress in
performing some task.  They are sometimes passed servers to give
feedback on the progress of the particular operation, and can
sometimes be accessed from within a server that wants to show its
progress on a slow operation using the host's normal feedback display.

A Monitor consists of some generic data and three functions: init,
step and done.  The `init' function is called first with the number of
steps in the process to be monitored, which is computed by the server.
As the task is processed, the `step' function is called with the
number of steps just completed (often one).  These step increments
should eventually add up to the total number and then the `done'
function is called, but `done' may be called early if there was a
problem or the process was aborted.  The `step' function will return
one if the user requested an abort and zero otherwise.

    (12)  Monitor types

	typedef struct st_Monitor {
		void             *data;
		void            (*init) (void *, unsigned int);
		int             (*step) (void *, unsigned int);
		void            (*done) (void *);
	} Monitor;

The server is masked from any errors in the monitor that may occur on
the host side of the interface.  If there is a problem with putting up
a monitor, the functions will still return normally, since the monitor
is for user feedback and is not that critical.

There are some macros provided to call a monitor which will do nothing
if the monitor pointer is null.  MON_INCR is used for step sizes
greater than one and MON_STEP is used for step sizes exactly one.

    (13)  Monitor declarations

	#define MON_INIT(mon,count)     if (mon) (*mon->init) (mon->data,
	   count)
	#define MON_INCR(mon,d)         (mon ? (*mon->step) (mon->data, d) :
	   0)
	#define MON_STEP(mon)           MON_INCR (mon, 1)
	#define MON_DONE(mon)           if (mon) (*mon->done) (mon->data)

These structures and macros are described in the `moni.h' header file.


4    Example Plug-in Service

This describes a hypothetical server class and creates some samples of
plug-in modules using it.  This serves as a testbed for third parties
to create test plug-ins, so it should have some general capability.


4.1    String Transform Class

This server class will perform manipulations on character strings,
like reverse them, capitalize them, etc.  This class will be
"StringXfrm".

A new server class is completely defined by the semantics of the
activation function for the class.  The activation function takes a
pointer argument from the host, `local' which is a reference to data
for the particular service the host needs performed.  It also gets a
`global' function pointer which will return global data as needed by
the server.

The `local' pointer will point to a StringLocal structure which holds
the data for the current operation.  This is a null-terminated string
and the length of the string buffer, plus a temporary scratch buffer
and its length.  The server will overwrite `buf' with the result, and
will set the `overflow' status flag if the buffers were too short.

    (14)  Test types

	typedef struct st_StringLocal {
		char            *buf;
		char            *tmpBuf;
		int              len, tmpLen;
		int              overflow;
	} StringLocal;
	. . .

For the string transform class of server, the global function can
return a `progress' function which can be called by the server to give
the user feedback about its progress.  This is returned using a string
ID of "Progress Function."

    (15)  Test types
	. . .
	typedef void            StringProgress (void);

We'll stick these definitions into the `_tplug.h' header file for test
modules to use.


4.2    String Transform Functions

The functions to do string transformations are all the same.  They all
get the same arguments as defined by the format of the activation
function.  The local pointer is specific to the string transform
class.  There is no ` serverData' for any of the transforms since
there is no Startup function.

    (16)  String transform arguments

	long                     version,
	GlobalFunc              *global,
	StringLocal             *local,
	void                    *serverData

String activation functions may return with an error code if the
version number is wrong or if the global progress function is not
available.

    4.2.1    Length Operation

    The length operation gets the length of the string and prints that
    as a number into the string buffer.

	(17)  Length function body

	    {
		    if (version != 1)
			    return AFUNC_BADVERSION;

		    if (local->len < 10)
			    local->overflow = 1;
		    else
			    sprintf (local->buf, "%ld", strlen (local->buf));

		    return AFUNC_OK;
	    }

    4.2.2    Reverse Operation

    The reverse operation copies the characters from the main buffer
    to the temp buffer in reverse order and then copies them back.
    This could use a swap operation to reverse them in place, but this
    method demonstrates using the temp buffer and returning an
    overflow if the temp buffer is too small.  This also calls the
    progress function as it swaps.

	(18)  Reverse function body

	    {
		    StringProgress          *progress;
		    int                      len, i;

		    if (version != 1)
			    return AFUNC_BADVERSION;

		    progress = (*global) ("Progress Function", GFUSE_TRANSIENT
		       );
		    if (!progress)
			    return AFUNC_BADGLOBAL;

		    len = strlen (local->buf);
		    if (local->tmpLen <= len) {
			    local->overflow = 1;
			    return AFUNC_OK;
		    }

		    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			    local->tmpBuf[i] = local->buf[len - i - 1];
			    (*progress) ();
		    }
		    local->tmpBuf[len] = 0;

		    strcpy (local->buf, local->tmpBuf);
		    return AFUNC_OK;
	    }

    4.2.3    Capitalization Operation

    This just passes through the string and converts each letter to
    uppercase, calling the progress function as it goes.  This will
    also use the global empty string if there are no characters
    passed.

	(19)  Capitalize function body

	    {
		    StringProgress          *progress;
		    const char              *empty;
		    char                    *c;

		    if (version != 1)
			    return AFUNC_BADVERSION;

		    progress = (*global) ("Progress Function", GFUSE_TRANSIENT
		       );
		    empty = (*global) ("EmptyStringText", GFUSE_TRANSIENT);
		    if (!progress || !empty)
			    return AFUNC_BADGLOBAL;

		    if (local->buf[0]) {
			    for (c = local->buf; *c; c++) {
				    (*progress) ();
				    if (*c >= 'a' && *c <= 'z')
					    *c = *c - 'a' + 'A';
			    }
		    } else
			    strncpy (local->buf, empty, local->len - 1);

		    return AFUNC_OK;
	    }

    4.2.4    Double Operation

    This doubles each character in the string by copying the buffer to
    the temp buffer and moving twice as many characters back into the
    buffer from there.  This will fail if the buffers are not big
    enough.

	(20)  Double function body

	    {
		    StringProgress          *progress;
		    int                      len, i;

		    if (version != 1)
			    return AFUNC_BADVERSION;

		    progress = (*global) ("Progress Function", GFUSE_TRANSIENT
		       );
		    if (!progress)
			    return AFUNC_BADGLOBAL;

		    len = strlen (local->buf);
		    if (local->tmpLen < len || local->len - 1 < len * 2) {
			    local->overflow = 1;
			    return AFUNC_OK;
		    }

		    strcpy (local->tmpBuf, local->buf);
		    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			    local->buf[i * 2]     = local->tmpBuf[i];
			    local->buf[i * 2 + 1] = local->tmpBuf[i];
			    (*progress) ();
		    }
		    local->buf[len * 2] = 0;

		    return AFUNC_OK;
	    }


4.3    Implementing Servers

A plug-in module is really a wrapper around the activation function,
and can be implemented several ways.  They can be single-service
plug-ins, multiple-service plug-ins, or built-in.  This test includes
one of each.

    4.3.1    Single-Service Plug-in -- Reverse

    The reverse operation is implemented as a single-service plug-in,
    so there is one global class and server name.  The activation
    function is called `Activate' (which it must be).

    The C program module itself includes the headers for the test
    system and server-side plug-ins.  The source file is `_tprev.c'.

	(21)  Test Reverse plug-in program

	    #include <splug.h>
	    #include "_tplug.h"
	    #include <string.h>

	    char            ServerClass[] = "StringXfrm";
	    char            ServerName[]  = "REVERSE";

		    XCALL_(int)
	    Activate (<String transform arguments>)
	    {
		    XCALL_INIT;
		    <Reverse function body>
	    }

    4.3.2    Multiple-Service Plug-in -- Caps & Double

    The capitalize and double operations are implemented as one
    multiple-service plug-in with two servers.  The activation
    function entry points can have any name and are not exported
    symbols.  They are associated with their server name in the
    exported array of ServerRecords which has the required name
    `ServerDesc'.  The source file for this is `_tpcpdb.c'.

    4.3.3    Built-in Server -- Length

    The length operation will be implemented as a built-in.  As
    result, all we need is a local function entry point of any name in
    the host program.

    4.3.4    Global Test Server

    This test program includes a global server which just returns a
    string for clients to use when passed an empty string.  This
    global's activation function gets a GlobalService request block
    with the `id' set to the requested string.  In this case, this
    MUST be the same as the server name.  The function returns a
    global pointer in the `data' field.

5    Creating a Plug-in

Methods for creating plug-ins have been developed for each of the
target platforms.  Versions of a plug-in can be created for the
different systems from a single source code with different linking
instructions.  Each case that follows includes an implicit makefile
rule to create a ".p" plug-in module from an object file.  The macro
SLIB stands for the directory where the startup code and server
libraries are located.  SINC is the include directory and OTHER_LIBS
would be any other libraries need by the module.

The final section shows how to add your plug-in to the LightWave host.


5.1    Microsoft's Windows

Plug-in modules under Windows are just DLLs created by linking with
`serv_w.obj' and `server.lib'.  There is no need to create a ".lib" or
".exp" file for the DLL, but the ".def" file should contain an export
statement for the global address `_mod_descrip'.  A usable default def
file is provided as "serv.def" in the main include directory.  There
is no DLL entry point function.

    (25)  Makefile examples

	.obj.p:
		link32 -dll -out:$@ -def:$(SINC)serv.def $*.obj\
		 $(SLIB)serv_w.obj server.lib $(OTHER_LIBS)
	. . .

Structure alignment may vary among different compilers and can cause
problems when trying to communicate between the host and a plug-in
DLL.  The LightWave host is compiled using Microsoft alignment rules.
Here's an excerpt on structure alignment from the MS Visual C
documentation:

"Applications should generally align structure members at addresses
that are 'natural' for the data type and the processor involved.  For
example, a 4-byte data member should have an address that is a
multiple of four.

"This principle is especially important when you write code for
porting to multiple processors.  A misaligned 4-byte data member,
which is on an address that is not a multiple of four, causes a
performance penalty with an 80386 processor and a hardware exception
with a MIPS« RISC processor.  In the latter case, although the system
handles the exception, the performance penalty is significantly
greater.  The following guidelines ensure proper alignment for
processors targeted by Win32:

    (26)  Alignment Table

	"Type                   Alignment
	 ----                   ---------
	 char                   Align on byte boundaries
	 short (16-bit)         Align on even byte boundaries
	 int and long (32-bit)  Align on 32-bit boundaries
	 float                  Align on 32-bit boundaries
	 double                 Align on 64-bit boundaries
	 structures             Largest alignment requirement of any member
	 unions                 Alignment requirement of the first member

"The compiler automatically aligns data in accordance with these
requirements, inserting padding in structures up to the limit (default
pack size) specified by the /Zp option or #pragma pack.  For example,
/Zp2 permits up to 1 byte of padding, /Zp4 permits up to 3 bytes of
padding, and so on.  The default pack size for Windows 3.x is 2,
whereas the default for Win32 is 8."


5.2    SGI Unix

Plug-in modules under IRIX are shared object modules linked with
`serv_u.o' and `libserver.lib'.  The DSO should export the
"_mod_descrip" symbol and use "serv_u" as startup code.

The link line should include any other libraries that the plug-in
would need as a stand-alone program.  Since most libs on the SGI are
themselves DSOs, this adds very little to the size of the plug-in and
adds no extra runtime overhead.

    (27)  Makefile examples
	. . .
	.o.p:
		ld -shared -exported_symbol _mod_descrip -L$(SLIB)\
		 $(SLIB)serv_u.o $*.o -o $@ -lserver $(OTHER_LIBS)

Normally the plug-in DSO's are loaded in a way that forces resolution
of all symbols.  This allows the host program to report undefined
symbols to the plug-in developer.  If the name of the module includes
the substring "__lazy" (lowercase), however, then the lazy evaluation
mode is used, allowing the module to contain undefined symbols as long
as they are not referenced by any executed code.  This is normally not
needed unless you are using code from an external vendor which
includes undefined but unused symbols, like the HIIP library from
Elastic Reality.


5.3    Macintosh OS

Plug-in modules on the Mac are shared libraries of type 'shlb'.  These
can be made from CodeWarrior by setting the project type to "Shared
Library."


5.4    Linking with LightWave

LightWave and Modeler read the names of servers from their startup
configuration files.  This method is much faster than scanning a
directory path and allows for some user customization of plug-in names
(such as national localization).  It does require that the config file
be accurate, since the host will blindly attempt to use servers that
may not exist.  This is non-fatal but may be disconcerting to the
user.

For Modeler, for example, the config file on the SGI is ".lwmrc", on
the Mac is "LightWave Modeler Prefs", and on Windows is "LWM.CFG".
This file can contain any number of lines of the following form:

    (28)  Config file examples

	Plugin <class> <name> <module> <user name>
	. . .

Each line describes a single server given by Class and Name.  The
module is the plug-in file containing the server and the user name is
the string to display on the interface for describing the server's
function.  Class, name and module are delimited by spaces, and the
user name is the rest of the line.  Here are some examples (lines wrap
for readability -- each statement has to be a single line).
