Compiling Plug-ins Under Borland C++ v4.52

I have been using both VC++ and BC4.52 . If you want to compile plug-ins
under BC 4.52, you just have to change serv_w.c.  To alter the file, you
should change the following structure declaration found in that file:

        ModuleDescriptor _mod_descrip = {
	        MOD_SYSSYNC,
	        MOD_SYSVER,
	        MOD_MACHINE,
	        Startup,
	        Shutdown,
	        ServerDesc
        };

to this:

        #ifdef BORLAND
        ModuleDescriptor mod_descrip = {
        #else
        ModuleDescriptor _mod_descrip = {
        #endif
	        MOD_SYSSYNC,
	        MOD_SYSVER,
	        MOD_MACHINE,
	        Startup,
	        Shutdown,
	        ServerDesc
        };

You must also define "BORLAND" in your compile so that the definition
added to serv_w.c (above) is activated.

Next, you should compile all C files found in the 'source' directory
into one library file.

      serv_w.c
      slib1.c
      slib2.c
      slib3.c
      slib4.c

Here are step-by-step instuctions:

I. Compiling libraries
    1. Choose projest/newproject...
          -set project path and target name
          -set Target Type to Static Library (for .dll) [.lib]
          -in Standard Libraries mark Static
          -set Platform to Win32
          -set Target Model to GUI
    2. Add nodes with files:
          -serv_w.c    (altered as described above)
          -slib1.c
          -slib2.c
          -slib3.c
          -slib4.c
    3. Options/project...
          -Directories : set include and lib paths
          -Compiler/Defines add _WIN32 , _X86_ and BORLAND
          -Compiler/Code Generation set Unsigned Characters and fastthis
          -32-bit Compiler set Processor and Data aligment to 8 bytes
    4. Compile project..

II. Compiling plug-in
    1. Choose projest/newproject...
          -set project path and target name
          -set Target Type to Dynamic Library [.dll]
          -in Standard Libraries mark Dynamic
          -set Platform to Win32
          -set Target Model to GUI
    2. In "def" file write 
         EXPORTS _mod_descrip
    3. Add nodes with your own source files
    4. Add node with library file (lib\server.lib)
    5. Remove unused nodes
    6. Options/project...
          -Directories : set include and lib paths
          -Compiler/Defines add _WIN32 and _X86_
          -Compiler/Code Generation set Unsigned Characters and fastthis
          -32-bit Compiler set Processor and Data aligment to 8 bytes
    7. Compile project..
