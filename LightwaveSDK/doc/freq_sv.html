LightWave makes some of its more common requests from the user using
standard dialogs.  These dialogs (or &quot;requesters&quot;) are used for getting
files and paths for saving and loading, and for getting color choices.
By default, the standard system dialogs are used, but these can be
overridden by plugins of the right class.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="S2"><h1>2. File Dialogs</h1></a>

The file dialog server class is &quot;FileRequester&quot; and the version is 3.
Version 1 was used in LightWave verisons 4.0 and 5.0, but no third party
plugin file dialogs were written so that version has been obsoleted.
<p>
The activation function for a file requester server performs the entire
operation at once.  The host passes a local structure defining the
request, the server opens a requester and gets a reply from the user
and returns that result back to the calling host.
<p>
A file requester should respect the current directory of the caller
when processing the request and should leave it unchanged.  It should
also allow the user to specify relative path names as well as fully
qualified ones.  (Both of these issues have to be specially coded 
when using the Windows common file dialogue.)

</ul>

<a name="S2.1"><h2>2.1. Activation Parameters</h2></a>

The local struct contains a set of values set mainly by the host to
specify the request and to receive results.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>reqType
<dd>This is one of the FREQ_* values below and defines the type of file request
being made by the host.  LOAD lets the user pick a single existing file
for reading.  SAVE lets the user pick a single file, existing or not, for
writing.  DIRECTORY lets the user pick a directory which will later be used
to locate files.  MULTILOAD lets the user pick one or more existing files
for reading.

</dl>
<dl><dd><h4>(1) Public types</h4></dl>
<pre>
	    #define FREQ_LOAD        1
	    #define FREQ_SAVE        2
	    #define FREQ_DIRECTORY   3
	    #define FREQ_MULTILOAD   4
	    . . .</pre>

<dl>
<dt>result
<dd>This is the return code from the request.  A value of 0 indicates that the
user canceled the request, and a value of 1 indicates that the request was
completed and a file was selected.
<dt>title
<dd>This is a possible title for the dialog to help remind the user what they
are supposed to select.
<dt>fileType
<dd>This string is the name of the type of file being requested.  In addition
to being a descriptive name for the user, this is also a key that can be
used to get a filename pattern for files that can be read and for the
default type for a new file.
<dt>path, baseName, fullName
<dd>These character buffers are provided by the caller to receive the name of
the selected file.  The path is the absolute or relative path for the file
and does not include the filename.  BaseName is the name of the file without
any path, and fullName is the combined result name.
<dt>bufLen
<dd>This is the minimum length of the three buffers above.
<dt>pickName
<dd>This is an optional callback which the host provides for the MULTILOAD
request type.  It will be called for each selected file and if it returns
a non-zero value the file processing should halt.

</dl>
<dl><dd><h4>(2) Public types</h4></dl>
<pre>
	    . . .
	    typedef struct st_FileReq_Local {
		    int              reqType, result;
		    const char      *title;
		    const char      *fileType;
		    char            *path;
		    char            *baseName;
		    char            *fullName;
		    int              bufLen;
		    int            (*pickName) (void);
	    } FileReq_Local;
	    <a href="#S2.3">. . .</a></pre>


<a name="S2.2"><h2>2.2. Process</h2></a>

The host first sets the request type, the title string and file type in the
local struct.  The host also sets the path and baseName buffers to contain
an initial path and filename for the dialog.  It sets the path, baseName and
fullName pointers and the bufLen is set to a value that will not overrun
any of the provided buffers.  If this is a MULTILOAD request type, the host
also sets the pickName callback.  It then passes this structure to the
server through the Activation function.
<p>
At this point the server displays the dialog to the user and allows him to 
make a choice starting from the initial path and filename.  If the user
cancels the request, the result is set to 0 and the server exits without
doing anything else.  For any of the single selection requests (LOAD, SAVE 
and DIRECTORY), the users' choice of file is written to the path, baseName 
and fullName buffers, the result is set to 1 and the server exits.
<p>
In the MULTILOAD case, the users' choices of files are written to the path,
baseName and fullName buffers one at a time and pickName is called for each.
This must be done even if only one file was selected.  The path buffer should
be left containing at least one path for the multiple selection and the
result should be set to 1 for success before the server exits.
<p>

<a name="S2.3"><h2>2.3. File Types</h2></a>

The host provides a global function to get filename patterns from
file type strings, returned by ID &quot;File Type Pattern&quot;.  This function
takes a file type string and returns a pattern used to match files of the
given type.  If the type is unknown, or the string is null, a generic
wildcard is returned to match all files on the system which will vary
depending on the host filesystem.
<p>
<dl><dd><h4>(3) Public types</h4></dl>
<pre>
	    <a href="#S2.1">. . .</a>
	    typedef const char      *FileTypeFunc (const char *);
	    <a href="#S3">. . .</a></pre>

On Windows, the file types are of the form &quot;*.xxx&quot; and are separated by
semicolons.  On the Mac, the file types are four-character file types,
also separated by semicolons.  For those two systems, the default type
for a new file is the first file type in the string.  On Unix, the file 
type is most likely a regular expression but may vary.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="S3"><h1>3. Color Dialogs</h1></a>

The color dialog server class is &quot;ColorPicker&quot; and the version is 3.
<p>
The interface is extremely simple.  The host sets the initial RGB value
for the color and passes that to the Activation function for the server.
The server displays a color dialog to the user and sets the result to
zero if the user cancels and one of the user picks a new color.  The host
can provide an optional hint about a title for the request.

	    typedef struct st_ColorPick_Local {
		    const char      *title;
		    int              red, green, blue;
		    int              result;
	    } ColorPick_Local;</pre>
