	<br><STRONG>AssignBoneVMaps</STRONG> is a plug-in for Lightwave 
      6.0 or greater. It provides a series of bone tools to aid in setting 
      up hierarchies. It contains six Generic plug-ins:
	  <A href="#AssignBoneVMaps"><STRONG>Assign Bone VMaps</STRONG></A>,    
	  <A href="#ActivateBones"><STRONG>Activate Bones</STRONG></A>,    
	  <A href="#DeactivateBones"><STRONG>Deactivate Bones</STRONG></A>,    
	  <A href="#ToggleActiveBones"><STRONG>Toggle Active Bones</STRONG></A>,    
	  <A href="#RecordBonePivots"><STRONG>Record Bone Pivots</STRONG></A> and
	  <A href="#RestBones"><STRONG>Rest Bones</STRONG></A>.
      All of these plug-ins operate on all selected bones, or on all bones in the currently selected 
      objects. This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>
	
	<P align=justify>To install AssignBoneVMaps, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy AssignBoneVmaps.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add AssignBoneVMaps.p. Layout should report that six plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave config and ensure that everything works properly.
	  <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>AssignBoneVMaps</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  
        Please refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.  The plug-ins will be
        prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>
	<br>
	<P><STRONG>AssignBoneVmaps</STRONG>  includes the following plugins:</P>

	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#AssignBoneVMaps"></a><STRONG>  </STRONG>
	<H3 align=center>Assign Bone VMaps
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
	<P align=justify><STRONG>
	  Assign Bone VMaps</STRONG> automatically assigns a weight map with the 
      same name as the bone to each selected bone, 
      or to each bone in the selected objects.  While this is is done automatically 
      by Layout when the object is loaded,  
		it is helpful when you change bone names after the fact, or when you 
		are having troubles with third party software failing to load objects 
		with weight maps, and thus you must manually re-assign them in 
		Layout. </P>
	<center>
    <p><IMG align=center alt="AssignBoneVMaps Interface" border=0 height=136 src="AssignBoneVMaps-Main.jpg" width=429></p>
    </center>
	<P align=justify>
	  <STRONG>Assign Bone VMaps</STRONG> 
      is used by selecting the bones, or the objects containing the bones, that 
      you want to modify.  If objects are selected, then all bones in those objects will
	  be affected.  After selecting the appropriate items, launch 
      <STRONG>Assign Bone VMaps</STRONG>.  You should see an interface similar to the one 
      here.  The <i>About</i> button, as you'd expect, presents information about
	  the plug-ins.</i></P>

	  <P>If <EM>Adjust Bone Settings</EM> is enabled, you'll be able to activate
	  <EM>Use Weight Maps Only</EM> and then <EM>Weight Normalization</EM>.
	  The state of these buttons will only be applied to the bones if
	  <EM>Adjust Bone Setings </EM>is enabled.  If all you want to do is
	  assign weight maps to bones, simply leave <EM>Adjust Bone Settings</EM>
	  in it's disabled state.</P>

      <P>After hitting <EM>Yes</EM>, <STRONG>AssignBoneVMaps</STRONG> will assign 
      each bone in the selection a weight map of the same name, and apply the 
      weight-based bone settings if <EM>Adjust Bone Settings</EM> is 
      enabled.  Clicking <EM>Cancel</EM> from the interface will return to 
      Layout with no changes performed.</P>
	
	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#ActivateBones"></a>
	<a name="#DeactivateBones"></a>
	<a name="#ToggleActiveBones"></a>
	<H3 align=center>
	ActivateBones<br>
	Deactivate Bones<br>
	Toggle Active Bones
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
	<P align=justify><STRONG>Activate Bones</STRONG>, 
      <STRONG>Deactivate Bones</STRONG> and <STRONG>Toggle 
      Active Bones</STRONG> are related plug-ins for acitavting and 
      deactivating bones.  While 
		Lightwave does include mappable commands for this already, those commands only operate on 
		the current item, while these plug-ins will operate on all selected bones, or all 
		bones in the selected objects. </P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Activate Bones</STRONG> will make th selected 
      bone active, just like the built-in <EM>Bone Active</EM> command.  
      <STRONG>Deactivate Bones</STRONG> will deactive the selected bones.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Toggle Active Bones</STRONG> will make the active 
      bones inactive, and force currently inactive bones to become active.  
      </P>
      <P align=justify>Note that none of these affect the bone's rest state; 
      they only modify the bone's active state.</P>
	
	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#RecordBonePivots"></a>
	<a name="#RestBones"></a>
	<H3 align=center>
	Record Bone Pivots<br>
	Rest Bones<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
      <P><STRONG>Record Bone Pivots</STRONG> will record the rotations of 
      the selected bones, or the bones of the selected objects, into the bone's 
      pivot point, just like <EM>Record Pivot Point</EM>, but operating on many 
      bones at the same time.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Rest Bones</STRONG> operates just like the built-in <EM>Rest 
      Bone</EM> command, but will affect any number of bones at once.</P>

      <P>Upon activation, both of these plug-ins will ask you if you really 
      want to perform this possibly dangerous operation.  If you click 
      <EM>Yes</EM>, the bones will be processed.  Note that the processing 
      occurs hierarchically, from the root of the parenting chain down to the 
      last children.  This ensures that the bones are rested as expected, 
      since resting in a non-hierarchical order can result in unpredictable 
      changes the bone chain.</P>
