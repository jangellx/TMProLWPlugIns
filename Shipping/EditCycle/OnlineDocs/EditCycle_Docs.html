	<br><STRONG>EditCycle</STRONG> is a 
	  plug-in for Lightwave 6.0 or greater. It simply provides some alternate ways to 
	  cycle through the available tools and edit modes in Layout. It contains two 
	  plug-ins, <A href="#ChangeEditMode"><STRONG>Change Edit Mode</STRONG></A> and
	  <A href="#MoveRotateCycler"><STRONG>Move/Rotate Cycler</STRONG></A>.
	  This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>
	
	<P align=justify>To install EditCycle, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy EditCycle.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add EditCycle.p. Layout should report that two plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>EditCycle</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-ins will be
		the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>
	<br>
	<P><STRONG>EditCycle</STRONG> includes the following plugins:</P>

	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#ChangeEditMode"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Change Edit Mode
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
	<P align=justify><STRONG>Change Edit Mode</STRONG>  
		cycles between the item edit modes in Layout, shifting between the Object, Bone Light 
		and Camera edit modes. This operates in a simlar to the 
		ChangeSelectionMode command in Modeler (the space bar in the default keyboard 
		layout). </P>

    <p align="center"><IMG alt="Change Edit Mode Example" border=0 height=17
	                       src ="EditCycle_ChangeEditMode.gif" width=277 ></p>

	<P align=justify> The plug-in determines the current edit mode 
		by reading the type of the currently selected item, changing to the next edit 
		mode in the order of Objects, Bones, Lights, Camears, and then back to Objects 
		again. If noitem are select, it is usually because there are no 
		items of that type in the scene . In this case, <STRONG>Change Edit 
		Mode</STRONG> assumes Layout is in Bone edit mode and skips ahead to Light edit mode, as you 
		are more likly to have no bones in an object than no objects in a scene, and it 
		keeps it from getting stuck in loops jumping from Object to 
		Bone mode. </P>
	
	<HR width="90%"><br>
	<a name="#MoveRotateCycler"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Move/Rotate Cycle
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
	<P align=justify>
	    <IMG HSpace=15 alt="Change Edit Mode Example" border=0 height=33 src ="EditCycle_MoveRotateCycle.gif" width=96 align=right >
	    <STRONG>Move/Rotate Cycle</STRONG> is 
		very similar to the Layout's ChangeTool command (the space bar in the default 
		keyboard layout), except it only cycles between the two tools that apply to 
		all items: Move and Rotate.</P>

	<P align=justify> Unlike <STRONG>Change Edit Mode</STRONG>, 
		there is no way for <STRONG>Move/Rotate Cycle</STRONG> to determine the currently active 
		tool. Instead, each time it is called it activates the 
		opposite tool from when it was last called, no matter what the currently active 
		tool is. This means that if you have activate the Move 
		Tool by clicking it's button on the Layout interface, and the last 
		tool <STRONG>Move/Rotate Cycle</STRONG> changed to was Rotate, calling 
		<STRONG>Move/Rotate Cycle</STRONG> will appear to do nothing as it tells Layout to 
		switch from the Move Tool back to the Move Tool. </P>
