	<P align=justify>To install <STRONG>Frame Jumper</STRONG>, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy FrameJumper.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add FrameJumper.p. Layout should report that 42 plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        <STRONG>Frame Jumper</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-ins will be
		the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>

	<H3 align=center>Frame Jumper
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
	<P align=justify><STRONG>Frame Jumper</STRONG> is a Master plug-in for marking and jumping to frames.  The Generic plug-ins
	   <a HREF="#JumpToNextMarker">Jump To Next Marker</a> and <a HREF="#JumpToPreviousMarker">Jump To Previous Marker</a>,
	   allow you to step through the markers from Layout, as well as creating and deleting markers via
       <a HREF="#MarkFrame">Mark Frame</a> and <a HREF="#UnmarkFrame">Unmark Frame</a>, and change groups
	   with <a HREF="#JumpToNextMarkerGroup">JumpToNextMarkerGroup</a> and
	   <a HREF="#JumpToPreviousMarkerGroup">JumpToPreviousMarkerGroup</a>.  Markers in a group
	   can be bound to keys or buttons in Layout using the <a HREF="#MarkFrameAs">Mark Frame As</a> and
       <a HREF="#JumpToMarker">Jump To Marker</a> generic plug-ins.

	<P align=justify><b>Frame Jumper</b> allows you to mark any number of frames, creating "markers".  You can
	   have any number of markers.  Markers are stored in groups, of which you can have as many as you like.
	   Markers and groups can be named, and markers can be disabled and set to a particular time or bound to a key.
	   All markers in the current group are presented in the <b>Frame Jumper</b> interface, which can be used to browse
	   the markers, change groups or modify markers.  You can also use the previously mentioned generic plug-ins
	   to cycle through and modify markers and groups directly from Layout.</P>
	   
	<P align=justify>There are two ways to activate <STRONG>Frame Jumper</STRONG>.  The simplest way is to
	   activate any of the above plug-ins, or the <a HREF="#FrameJumperProperties">Frame Jumper Properties</a>
	   Generic.  These automatically add the <b>Frame Jumper</b> Master plug-in.  The other option is to
	   manually add the <b>Frame Jumper</b> Master from Layout's Plug-in Options panel; just select it
	   from the Master pop-up.</p>

	<P align=justify><b>Frame Jumper</b>'s interface can be opened by double-clicking on
	   the activated Master plug-in from the Plug-in Options Panel, or by activating the
	   <a HREF="#FrameJumperProperties">Frame Jumper Properties</a> generic.
	   This opens a non-modal panel, meaning you can leave it open while you work in Layout.  You can resize
	   the interface vertically by dragging the lower-right corner of the panel, where the diagonal lines
	   are drawn.  Below is an example of the interface.</p>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Frame Jumper Master Interface" border=0 height=358 src="FrameJumper-Main.jpg" width=225></p>

	<P align=justify>At the top of the interface is the the <i>Units</i> pop-up.  This determines
	   if the times are displayed and entered in Seconds or Frames.</p>

	<P align=justify>The About button at the bottom right will pop up information about <b>Frame Jumper</b>
	   and it's related plug-ins, as well as the keyboard equivilants for the interface.</P>

   	<P align=justify>The most important part of the interface is the lister.  This dislpays all marked frames,
	   and is sorted by time.  Double-clicking a particular marker will jump to that time in Layout.
	   The first column of the list shows if the marker is currently enabled.  Disabled markers are skipped by the
	   <a HREF="#JumpToNextMarker">Jump To Next Marker</a> and <a HREF="#JumpToPreviousMarker">Jump To Previous Marker</a>
	   Generic plug-ins.  You can click in this column to enable or disable a marker.  The second column marks the frame
	   that the marker points to.  The third column displays the name of the marker.  The final column displays the
	   key that the marker is bound to, with nothing displayed for an unbound marker.  The key corresponds to one
	   of the twelve </P>

	<P align=justify>
       <IMG alt="Group Popup" border=0 height=80 src="FrameJumper-Group.jpg" width=133 align=right hspace=15>
	   Just above the lister is the <i>Group</i> pop-up.  This allows you to select the currently
	   active group.  The lister will show only the markers in that group.  You can use theedit field to change the
	   group name at any time.  By clicking on the pop-up to the right of the field, you can change groups to any
	   above the divider.  The Create Group entry allows you to create a new, empty group.  Delete Group clears
	   the current group and all of it's markers.  If no more groups exist, a new, empty group will be created.

	<P align=justify>The <i>Modify</i> button toggles between the default browser mode and the advanced edit mode.
	   When enabled, new controls will be made visible at the bottom of the interface, as seen in the example
	   below.</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Frame Jumper Master Interface" border=0 height=435 src="FrameJumper-Modify.jpg" width=225></p>

   	<P align=justify>The <i>Add</i> button will add a new marker to the list at the current Layout time
	   to the current group.  You can have any number of markers in each group.  <i>Remove</i> will remove
	   the currently selected marker from the list.</P>

   	<P align=justify>The <i>Name</i> field allows you to change the name of the currently selected marker.
	   This can be anything you like; it is just a label for your reference.</P>

	<P align=justify><i>When</i> is the time that this marker points to.  This will be in seconds or frames,
	   depending on the state of the <i>Units</i> pop-up.</P>

   	<P align=justify><i>Enable</i> toggles the active state of the marker.  Disabled markers will be skipped
	   by the <a HREF="#JumpToNextMarker">Jump To Next Marker</a> and
	   <a HREF="#JumpToPreviousMarker">Jump To Previous Marker</a> generics.</P>

	<P align=justify>The <i>Key</i> pop-up allows you to bind a marker to one of the
	   <a HREF="#JumpToMarker">Jump To Marker</a> generic plug-ins.  Setting this to Off unbinds the marker.
	   Setting it to any other value binds the current marker to that key, and unbinds any other marker in
	   the same group that may have been using that key.</P>

   	<P align=justify>The <i>In Group</i> pop-up allows you to change the group that the currently selected
	   marker belongs to.  The marker will immediatly jump to the new group and be removed from the current
	   group's list.  If a marker in the new group has is bound to the same key as this marker, the existing
	   marker will be reset to Off and the new marker will take precedence.</P>

	<H3 align=center>Loading, Saving and Load From Scene
	  <HR width=50%></H3>

	<P align=justify><i>FrameJumper</i> only allows one instance of itself to be in the scene at a time.  It
	   will automatically detect multiples of itself and remove it (although it might have to wait until the
	   next event occurs first).  All instances share the same data, and nothing is cleared from memory until
	   all instances have been removed.</P>

  	<P align=justify>If for some reason multiple instances exist and you save the scene, only the first instance
	   will save data, so you don't have to worry about the data being saved twice or other wacky effects.  This
	   will only happen if you add the Master plug-in and immediatly save the scene, so it should be fairly rare.
	   On scene load, only the first instance's data will load, and the rest will be considered as duplicates and
	   be ignored.<P>

  	<P align=justify>In the case of Load From Scene, however the first instance in the scene will be loaded, and
	  it's groups will be added to the data already loaded into the scene.  This ensures that the new groups are
	  loaded without change, while the original groups remain intact.  As with loading, all other instances in 
	  the scene will be skipped.</P>

  	<P align=justify>There are twelve each of the <b>Mark Frame As</b> and <b>Jump To Marker</b> plug-ins,
