	<br><STRONG>SaveObjects</STRONG> is a plug-in for Lightwave 
      6.0 or greater. It provides many more options for saving objects from Layout.
	  The file contains six Generic plug-ins:
	  <A href="#SaveObjects"><STRONG>SaveObjects</STRONG></A>, the core plug-in,
	  <A href="#BackupAndSaveObject"><STRONG>Backup And Save Object</STRONG></A>,
	  <A href="#ReplaceWithBackupObject"><STRONG>Replace With Backup Object</STRONG></A>,
	  <A href="#SaveNewObjectRevision"><STRONG>Save New Object Revision</STRONG></A>,
	  <A href="#ReplaceWithNextObjectRevision"><STRONG>Replace With Next Object Revision</STRONG></A> and
	  <A href="#ReplaceWithPreviousObjectRevision"><STRONG>Replace With Previous Object Revision</STRONG></A>,
      This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install SaveObjects, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy SaveObjects.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add SaveObjects.p. Layout should report that six plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave config and ensure that everything works properly.
	  <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>SaveObjects</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  
        Please refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.  The plug-ins will be
        prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>
	<br>
	<P><STRONG>SaveObjects</STRONG>  includes the following plugins:</P>

	<H3 align=center>Save Objects
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
    <P align=justify><STRONG>Save Objects</STRONG>, the core plug-in,
	provides an interface for selecting and saving objects.  It includes features for
	optionally overwriting read-only files, as well as setting the files to read-only
	or read-write after they have been saved.  A series of versioning features allow
	for creating backups, incrementing revisions, revision backups and duplicating the
	object on disk.</P>

	<center>
    <p align=center><IMG align=center alt="SaveObjects Interface" border=0 height=538 src="SaveObjects-Main.jpg" width=455></p>
    </center>

	<P align=justify>After running <b>Save Objects</b>, you should see an interface similar to the one above.
	In simplest terms, <b>Save Objects</b> is used by marking the objects you want to save, choosing a <i>Post
	Save File Mode</i>, a <i>Versioning Mode</i>, maybe enabling <i>Save Read-Only Objects</i> and finally
	clicking <i>Save Marked Objects</i> to begin processing.  Clicking <i>Continue</i> will exit the plug-in
	without doing anything.  The <i>?</i> button at the top-right will open the <i>About Save Objects</i>
	panel.</P>
	
	<P align=justify>The lister contains four columns detailing objects from the scene.  Which objects are
	listed is determined by the <i>Limit To</i> pop-up.  Clones and null objects are automatically culled
	out of the list, so you don't have to worry about them. The first column is used to mark an object for saving.
	You can click in this column to mark or unmark an objects.  The second column displays the object's name.
	The third column shows if this object is read-only on disk.  The final column is specific to the versioning
	mode, and will display the latest revision number on disk, or show if there's a duplicate or backup exists.</P>

	<P align=justify>
    <IMG align=right alt="Limit To Popup" border=0 height=65 src="SaveObjects-LimitTo.jpg" width=121 hspace=15>
	The <i>Limit To</i> pop-up allows you to limit which objects are shown in the lister.  The
	options are <i>All Object</i>, meaning all objects will be displayed in the lister, <i>Selected Objects</i>,
    which limits the display to just the objects selected within Layout, and <i>Current Object</i>, which shows
	only the most recently selected item in Layout.  Clones and null objects will never be displayed.  Note that
	changing the <i>Limit To</i> mode will unmark any previously marked objects.</P>

	<P align=justify>If <i>Alpha</i> is active, the lister will be sorted alphabetically.  Otherwise, the
	objects are listed in natural order, meaning the same order the objects were loaded into Layout</P>

	<P align=justify><i>Refresh</i> can be used to update the columns of the lister, in case something has
	changed on disk between since the last time the list was refreshed.</P>

    <P align=justify>
    <IMG align=right alt="Mark Objects To Save Popup" border=0 height=155 src="SaveObjects-Mark.jpg" width=136 hspace=15>
	The <i>Mark Objects To Save</i> pop-up allows you to quickly mark objects to be saved from basic criteria.
    Only objects that are marked will actually be processed when <i>Save Marked Objects</i> is clicked.  You can also
	click in the <i>Save</i> column in the lister to mark individual objects to save.</P>

    <P align=justify>
	Use <i>Mark All</i> to mark all objects for saving, and <i>Unmark All</i> to save nothing.  <i>Mark Read Only</i> and
	<i>Unmark Read Only</i> will mark or unmark objects that are read-only on disk.  <i>Mark Read/Write</i> and
	<i>Unmark Read/Write</i> will mark or unmark objects that can be both read and written on disk.  <i>Invert Marked</i>
	will set all marked objects to unmarked, and visa-versa.
	</P>

    <P align=justify>
    <IMG align=right alt="Post-Save File Mode Popup" border=0 height=65 src="SaveObjects-FileAttrib.jpg" width=149 hspace=15>
	The <i>Post-Save File Mode</i> pop-up determines what the read-only state of any object will be after it has
	been saved.  It can be set to <i>Read-Only</i>, thus write protecting the file on disk, or <i>Read/Write</i>,
	allowing you to save over, rename and delete the object without having to change it's fine attributes.
	The final mode, <i>Previous State</i>, will return the object to it's previous file mode after saving it;
	for example, if the object was originally read-only, it will again be read-only after it is saved.
	Note that this state affects all files saved or modified by the <i>Versioning Mode</i>, including backups
	and duplicates.  If a particular <i>Versioning Mode</i> doesn't modify the original object, it's attributes
	won't be affected.</P>

    <P align=justify>
	<i>Save Read-Only Objects</i>, when enabled, allows read-only objects to be overwritten.  If this is disabled,
	only objects listed as read/write will be saved.</P>

    <P align=justify>
    <IMG align=right alt="SaveObjects Interface" border=0 height=110 src="SaveObjects-Versioning.jpg" width=150 hspace=15>
	<i>Versioing Mode</i> provides alternate ways to save your objects.  The default mode, <i>Disabled</i>, does
	nothing special; it simply saves the object to disk, just like saving an object from Layout.  The <i>Rev/Backup</i>
	column of the lister will change depending on the mode selected.</P>

	<a name="#BackupOriginal"></a>
    <P align=justify><i>Backup Original</i> will rename the original object on disk to end in .lwo-bu, then save the
	object from Layout to disk under the original name.  If a backup already exists on disk, it will be deleted before
	the original object is renamed.  Since the backup's name ends in .lwo-bu, it won't show up in the normal <i>Load Object</i>
	file requests from Layout, so it won't clutter up your view too much.  When this <i>Versioning Mode</i> is selected,
	the <i>Rev/Backup</i> column of the lister will display <i>Backed Up</i> if a backup exists on disk.</p>

	<a name="#NewRevision"></a>
    <P align=justify><i>New Revision</i> will a new, uniquely-reivisioned object to disk.  The <i>Min. Digits</i> field
	determines both the minimum number of digits that will be saved, and the minimum number of digits that must already
	exist at the end of the object's name for it to be considered a revision.  For example, if the object is named
	Test2.lwo and <i>Min. Digits</i> is set to 2, then no revision will be recognized.  If the object was named Test02.lwo,
	however, then a revision of 02 will be found.  The latest revision number found on disk will be displayed in the
	<i>Rev/Backup</i> column of the lister, even if that number is greater than that currently loaded into Layout.
	If no revisions exist, the column will show <i>(none)</i>.  Note that the original object will not be modified
	in any way.</P>

	<P align=justify>The following table shows how revisions are added to objects based on their name and
	<i>Min. Digits</i>.  Of signifigance is that if the name ends in digit, but it isn't considered part 
	of the revision due to <i>Min Digits</i>, then a dash will be insterted before the revision is added.<p>
    <table cellpadding=5 border=1 align=center>
	  <tr><td>Object Name</td>    <td>            Min. Digits</td>  <td>              Latest Revision</td>  <td>Output Name    </td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Test.lwo    </td>   <td align=right>          3</td>  <td align=right>           (none)</td>  <td>Test001.lwo    </td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Test.lwo    </td>   <td align=right>          3</td>   <td align=right>             005</td>  <td>Test006.lwo    </td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Test006.lwo </td>   <td align=right>          3</td>   <td align=right>             006</td>  <td>Test007.lwo    </td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Test20.lwo  </td>   <td align=right>          2</td>   <td align=right>              20</td>  <td>Test21.lwo     </td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Test20.lwo  </td>   <td align=right>          3</td>   <td align=right>          (none)</td>  <td>Test20-001.lwo </td></tr>
	</table>

    <P align=justify><i>Revision Backup</i> is similar to the <i>New Revision</i> mode.  Instead of creating
	a new revision in the same directory as the original object, it creates the new revision in the directory
	specified by the <i>Path</i> field, as well as saving over the original object.  This means that the object
	in the "main" directory will have the same name and always be the most recent version, but revisions
	will also be stored in the backup directory specified in the <i>Path</i> field.  Note that
	if <i>Path</i> is a relative path, meaning that it has no drive part, the revision will be saved in a
	new directory relative to the object's original directory.  If the path is absolute, then all the revisions
	for the marked objects will go there.  If the path doesn't exist, it will automatically be created.
	If no revisions exist for the object at <i>Path</i>, the original object is also revisioned by coping it
	to the backup path as revision 0.</P>

    <P align=justify><i>Duplicate</i> and <i>Duplicate And Replace</i> will create a duplicate object.  The
	object can have a <i>Prefix</i> or <i>Suffix</i> added to it, and can be duplicated to a different
	location via the <i>Path</i> field.  Relative and absolute paths acts similarly to <i>Revision Backup</i>
	mode.  In <i>Duplicate</i> mode, the object is saved under a new name, but the object in Layout isn't
	replaced, similar to Layout's built-in <i>Save Object Copy</i> command.  <i>Duplicate And Replace</i>
	will save the object in a new path and replace the object in Layout with it.  Note that neither of
	these modes affect the original object in any way.

    <P align=justify>As mentioned above, <i>Min. Digits</i>, <i>Path</i>, <i>Prefix</i> and <i>Suffix</i>
	are used by specific <i>Versioning Mode</i>s.  The following table outlines which modes use which
	fields:</p>

	<table cellpadding=5 border=1 align=center>
	  <tr><td>                     </td> <td>             Min. Digits</td> <td>             Path</td>  <td>             Prefix</td> <td>             Suffix</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Disabled             </td> <td align=center>          -</td> <td align=center>   -</td>  <td align=center>     -</td> <td align=center>     -</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Backup Original      </td> <td align=center>          -</td> <td align=center>   -</td>  <td align=center>     -</td> <td align=center>     -</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>New Revision         </td> <td align=center>        Yes</td> <td align=center>   -</td>  <td align=center>     -</td> <td align=center>     -</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Revision Backup      </td> <td align=center>        Yes</td> <td align=center> Yes</td>  <td align=center>     -</td> <td align=center>     -</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Duplicate            </td> <td align=center>          -</td> <td align=center> Yes</td>  <td align=center>   Yes</td> <td align=center>   Yes</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Duplicate And Replace</td> <td align=center>          -</td> <td align=center> Yes</td>  <td align=center>   Yes</td> <td align=center>   Yes</td></tr>
	</table>

	<P align=justfy>When you have all your objects marked and options set, click <i>Save Marked Objects</i>
	to start saving.  If something is wrong, such as all files are read-only but <i>Save Read-Only Objects</i>
	is disabled, you will be presented with an error message and the status field will turn red.  If some
	other error occurs to a particular object during processing, an object-specific error message will appear,
	but processing will continue.  As objects are saved, the status field draws a progress bar and displays
	the name of the object that is currently being saved.  You can then click <i>Continue</i> to return to
	Layout.</P>

	<H3 align=center>
	Backup And Save Object<br>
	Replace With Backup Object
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

	<P align=justify><STRONG>Backup And Save Object</STRONG> operates very similar to
	the <a href="#BackupOriginal"><i>Backup</i></a> versioning mode in <b>Save Objects</b>.
	Upon launching, it will rename the original object to end in .lwo-bu, deleting any
	existing .lwo-bu first, and then save the object from Layout over with the original
	name.  This means that you will always have the previous version of your object as
	a backup of your object. Since the backup's name ends in .lwo-bu, Layout's <i>Load
	Object</i> file requester won't show them, so they won't clutter up your view.  This
	plug-in has no interface; it operates as soon as you select it.</P>

	<P align=justify><STRONG>Replace With Backup Object</STRONG> will look for a .lwo-bu
	object on disk.  If it exists, the original .lwo and the .lwo-bu's filenames will be
	swapped, and the object will be reloaded.  This has the net effect of loading the backup
	back into Layout, but with the same name as the original.  You can repeatedly swap back
	and forth between the original and the backup by calling <b>Replace With Backup Object</b>
	over and over again.  This plug-in has no interface;  it operates as soon as you select it.
	If the backup doesn't exist, an error message will appear to let you know.</P>

	Save New Object Revision<br>
	Replace With Next Object Revision<br>
	Replace With Previous Object Revision<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

    <P align=justify><b>Save New Object Revision</b> operates similarly to the <i>New Revision</i>
	versioning mode in <b>Save Objects</b>, with two as the hard-coded mimimum number of digits.
	See the <a href="#NewRevision"><i>New Revision</i></a> documention above for specific details.
	This plug-in has no interface;  it operates as soon as it is run.</P>

    <P align=justify><b>Replace With Next Object Revision</b> will load the next object revision from
	disk, if one exists.  The rules for determining the revision are the same as those for the
	<a href="#NewRevision"><i>New Revision</i></a> versioning mode in <b>Save Objects</b>.  If no
	revision immediatly follows the current revision, an error message pops up to let you know and
	the original object remains in memory.  This plug-in has no interface;  it operates as soon as
	it is run.</P>

    <P align=justify><b>Replace With Previous Object Revision</b> will load the previous object
	revision from disk, if one exists.  The rules for determining the revision are the same as those
	for the <a href="#NewRevision"><i>New Revision</i></a> versioning mode in <b>Save Objects</b>.
	If no revision immediatly follows the current revision, an error message pops up to let you know
