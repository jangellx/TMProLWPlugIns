	<br><STRONG>Content Director</STRONG>
	  is a plug-in that for managing content directories in Lightwave 6 or greater.  It provides an interface
	  for selecting the current content directory from a list of common directories, as well as tools to edit
	  the list, and can even create new content directory structures from scratch.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install <b>Content Director</b>, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy ContentDirector.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add ContentDirector.p. Layout should report that two plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        <STRONG>Content Director</STRONG> plug-in from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign it to a key 
        or button on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.  The plug-in will be
		prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>

	<hr width="90%">
	
	<P align=justify><STRONG>Content Director</STRONG> has two main modes.  The first mode is for quickly selecting
	   which content directory you want.  You should see an interface similar to the one below after activating
	   <b>Content Director</b>.  Simply select the content directory from the list and hit <i>Continue</i>, and
	   the content directory will be changed.

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Interface" border=0 height=348 src="ContentDirector-Main2.jpg" width=526></p>

	<P align=justify>The <i>Current Content</i> fields present the current content directory set in Layout.
     If the content directory matches one of the entries in the list, it's name will be displayed in the
	   field to the left.  The <i>Select</i> button will select the current content dir if it exists in the
	   list.</P>

	<P align=justify>The list shows all the available content directories.  The QCD column shows which of the
     fields is marked for <strong>QuickCD</strong>, providing one-click access to changing that content directory through the
     <strong>QuickCD</strong> generic plug-in.  The comment column displays the comment for this directory.  This is just some
     meaningful name for you to remember which path is used for what purpose.  The from column shows if this content directory's
     path is from an environment variable or a specific directory.  The next column is the path for
     this content directory.  The Exists column displays a check if the path exists, and is empty if it doesn't.</P>

    <P align=justify>The <i>About</i> button, as you'd expect, will present some information about this plug-in.</P>

	<P align=justify><i>Modify Dirs</i> switches <b>Content Director</b> into it's second mode.  When active,
	   a series of new buttons and edit controls will appear, allowing you to modify the contents of the list.
	   The expanded interface should look like the image below.</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Modify Dirs Interface" border=0 height=469 src="ContentDirector-Modify2.jpg" width=524></p>

    <P align=justify>New content directories can be added to the list with the <i>Add</i> button.  The new
	   entry will be selected so you can start editing it immediatly. You can add the current content
	   directory as a new entry with the <i>Add Current</i> button.</P>

    <P align=justify><i>Duplicate</i> will make a copy of the selected entry, providing a base for
	   creating new content directories.</P>

    <P align=justify><i>Remove</i> will remove an entry from the list and select the previous entry.</P>

	<P align=justify><i>Shift Up</i> and <i>Shift Down</i> allow you to change the ordering of items in
	   the list, shifting the selected item one step up or down the list, respectivly.</P>

	<P align=justify>The edit fields under the list provide options for changing entries in the list.
	   The <i>Comment</i> field lets you give each content directory 
      a meaningful name so you can easilly identify the projects associated with this directory.</P>
      <P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt  ="Path From Popup" border=0 height=50 hspace=15 src="ContentDirector-PathFrom.jpg" width=100 > The
     popup and edit fields underneath are for picking the 
     content directory itself. If set to <EM>Specific Dir</EM>, 
     the field will represent the path to the content directory; clicking 
     the button to it's right will open a directory requester for selecting a 
     path.; If set to <EM>Env Var</EM>, this is the name of an environment 
     variable. The popup to the right of the field will list all environment variables on your system. You
	   can use the  <i>Test Path</i> button to make sure the directory exists.</P>

	<P align=justify>The <EM>Mark as QuickCD's path</EM> 
      check&nbsp;will mark this path for use by <STRONG>QuickCD</STRONG>.&nbsp; 
      One use for this feature is to make <STRONG>QuickCD</STRONG> your 
      StartupCommand and use an environment variable for the content directory's 
      path.&nbsp; Each time you start Layout, the content directory will 
      automatically be set to match the environment variable.</P>
      <P align=justify>Normally, <b>Content Director</b> stores it's configuration file in the same directory
	   as Lightwave's config.  To make content directory management easier at large facilities, it can instead
	   use a shared config.  In shared mode, the local config contains only the name of the shared config, and
	   all the entries are loaded from the shared file.  The configuration file is automatically saved when
	   the panel is closed.  To keep users from saving over a shared config, you can make the shared config
	   file Read-Only.  If the file cannot be opened (ie: because it is Read-Only), <b>Content Director</b> will not save it's configs.</P>

	<P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt  ="Config From Popup" border=0 height=50 hspace=15 src="ContentDirector-Config.jpg" width=115 >
	   The <i>Config From</i> pop-up lets you choose where the configuration file is saved.  The
	   default <i>Local</i> mode stores all the data in a file named ContentDirector.cfg in the same directory
	   as the Lightwave config.</P>

	<P align=justify>Setting the <i>Config From</i> pop-up to <i>Shared</i> mode activates the <i>Shared Config Path</i>
	   field.  This lets you pick where the shared config exists.  In larger facilities, this would normally be a network
	   drive that all users can access.  Settings will be loaded from and saved to this path, with the local config
	   storing only the shared config's name.</P>

	<P align=justify><i>Reload</i> will restore the original config file from disk, canceling any changes made to
	   the content directories.  Which config is loaded is determined by the current state of the <i>Config Form</i>
       pop-up.</P>

   	<P align=justify>At the very bottom of the interface is the <i>Status Field</i>, which provides updates on the
	   current state of <b>Content Directory</b>.  The <i>Set Content Directory</i> button will change the current
	   content directory to the one selected in the list immediately, but without closing the panel.  Note that
	   hitting <i>Continue</i> will also change the content directory to the currently selected entry.</P>

	<P align=justify>Note that if you have the Options Panel in Layout open and then use <b>Content Director</b> to
	   change the content directory, the Options Panel will still display the old content directory.  The path
	   really has changed, though; the Options Panel just hasn't updated it's display.  Closing and re-opeing the
	   Options Panel will show the corret path.</P>

	<br><br>
    <H3 align=center>Creating New Content Directory Structures
    <HR width="50%"></H3>

	<P align=justify>The <i>Create</i> button is the gateway to creating completely new content directory structures
	   from scratch.  This allows you not only create the content directory itself, but also any combination of
	   directories and sub-directories within.  After clicking <i>Create</i>, you should see an interface like
	   the one below.</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Create Interface" border=0 height=152 src="ContentDirector-Create.jpg" width=499></p>

	<P align=justify><i>Create Root</i> specifies the path to the new content directory.  If it doesn't exist, it
	   will automatically be created with the rest of the directories.</P>

   	<P align=justify>When enabled, <i>Add To List</i> will add the newly-created content directory to the main
	   content directory list.  The comment will be the same as the content directory's name, and it will
	   automatically be selected in the list.</P>

   	<P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt   ="Content Director Create Interface" border=0 height=65 hspace=15 src="ContentDirector-Base.jpg" width=87 ></P>
	   The <i>Base</i> pop-up lets you decide what sub-directories should be created in the content
	   directory.  <i>Root Only</i> will create only the <i>Root Dir</i>, if it doesn't already exist.
	   <i>Default</i> will create the 
      standard set of directories within the root: Scenes, Objects, Images, 
      Motions, Envelopes, Surfaces and Previews.
      <P></P>

    <P align=justify>The <i>Template</i> <i>Base</i> mode allows you to specify an exact directory
	   configuration via a text file.  This file contains a simple header as it's first line ("ContentDirectorTemplate 1")
	   followed by any number of directories to create with any number of sub-directories.  Each directory to create
	   must be on a seperate line, although compound directories are allowed (such as "Scenes/Tests")  Any leading
	   or trailing white space (tabs or spaces) on the line will be removed before the directory is created.  A template
	   should not contain any absolute paths, meaning there should be no paths containing drive specifications like
	   "C:\".  Any line starting with a semi-colon will be considered a comment and will be skipped.</P>

    <P align=justify>The <i>Template</i> field to the right of the <i>Base</i> pop-up allows you to select the
	   template file you want to use.  For an example of how to create a template, click the Create Example button.
	   This will generate a file like the following:</P>


<table align=center border=1><tr><td width="5%"></td><td>
<pre>
ContentDirectorTemplate 1
; This is a comment.  Any line that starts with a semi-colon is a comment.
;  The first line of a Content Director Template must be exactly as above,
;  containing first the word ContentDirectorTemplate, and then the number
;  1 (one).  The number is the version of the template, which may change
;  as more feature are added in the future.
;
; Insert the names of the directories you want to create after these
;  comments.  The paths should be relative to the content directory, so no
;  drive letters.  Sub-directories can also be specified, such as
;  Scenes/Test.  All blank and commented lines will be skipped. All leading
;  and trailing white space will be removed before creating any directories.
;  Each directory must otherwise be on it's own line.

; Default Directories
Scenes
Objects
Images
Motions
Envelopes
Surfaces
Previews
</pre>
</td><td width="5%"></td></tr></table>
	   
	<P align=justify>After the options are set the way you like, click <i>Create Dirs</i> to build the content
	   directory structure.  The status field to the left will fill as directories are created, and will turn
	   red when reporting an error.  Click continue to close return to the main interface.</P>
