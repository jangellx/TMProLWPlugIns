	<br><STRONG>Motify</STRONG>
	  is a replacement Delete Key panel for Lightwave 6.0 or greater.  It includes more advanced features, including
	  clearing motions, deleting ranges of keys and deleting keys within a threshold.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install Mot-ify, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy Motify.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add Motify.p. Layout should report that one plug-in has been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        <STRONG>Mot-ify</STRONG> plug-in from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign it to a key 
        or button on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-in will be
		the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>

	<P align=justify><STRONG>Mot-ify</STRONG> is designed to completely replace the Delete Key panel
	built into Lightwave 6, and you can use it in exactly the same way.  It is recommended that you
	replace your default Delete Key key (the Delete key in the default keyboard layouts) with
	Mot-ify so it is always available, as well as providing you with more advanced options than
	Delete Key at a keystroke.

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Mot-ify Interface" border=0 height=184 src="Motify-Main.jpg" width=432></p>

	<P align=justify>To use <STRONG>Mot-ify</STRONG>,
       you must first select the item you want to delete keyframes from.  Once you have selected
	   the appropriate items, launch <b>Mot-ify</b>.  You should see an interface simlar to the one
	   shown above.  Using <b>Mot-Ify</b> involes selecting some items, choosing a <i>Delete Mode</i>,
	   entering a range and threshold, enabling or disabling channels, choosing a <i>For</i> mode,
	   and hitting OK to process the keyframes.   Most of these steps are optional; to simply delete
	   a keyframe at the current time in the previous <i>For</i> mode, launch <b>Mot-ify</b> and
	   click <i>OK</i>.  Clicking <i>Cancel</i> will exit without modifing any motions.</P>

	<P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt="For Popup" border=0 height=95 src="Motify-For.jpg" width=195 hspace=15>
	   Most of these options should look familiar from the Delete Key panel.  For example,
	   the Position, Rotation and Scale buttons, and the individual channel buttons operate in the exact
	   same manner as those in the Delete Key panel.  The <i>For</i> pop-up also identical, except that
	   it includes a new option, <i>Selected Items And Descendants</i>, which is conspicuously missing
	   from the the built-in panel.  As with Delete Key, <i>For</i> determines which objects will have
	   their keys deleted.</P>

	<P align=justify>The main differences come at the top of the interface.  <i>Delete Mode</i> determines
	   what Mot-ify does to the item's motion.  The default mode, <i>Delete Key</i>, forces <b>Mot-ify</b>
	   to act exactly like the built-in Delete Key command, deleteing the key at the specified time.  Both
	   integer and fractional keyframe values can be entered.  The <i>Threshold</i> field can be used to
	   determine how close a keyframe has to be to the choosen frame to be deleted.  This is useful for
	   deleting fractional keyframes when <i>Allow Fractional Current Frame</i> is disabled in Layout's
	   Options Panel.</P>

    <P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt=" Popup" border=0 height=140 src="Motify-Modes.jpg" width=171 hspace=15>
	   <i>Delete Keys Within Range</i> will delete all keyframes between the <i>To</i> and <i>From</i>
	   frames, including the <i>To</i> and <i>From</i> frames themselves.  As with <i>Delete Key</i> mode,
	   the <i>Threshold</i> can be used to delete keys around before <i>To</i> and after <i>From</i>, although
	   now matter what the threshold is, all keys within the range will be deleted.<P>

	<P align=justify>
	   <i>Delete Keys Outside Range</i> will delete all keyframes outside the <i>To</i> and <i>From</i>
	   frames, not including the <i>To</i> and <i>From</i> frames themselves.  <i>Threshold</i> is not
	   used in thise mode; it only applies to modes where the <i>To</i> or <i>From</i> frames are
	   also deleted.<P>

    <P align=justify>
	   <i>Delete Keys Before Range</i> deletes all keyframes before the <i>To</i> frame.  Similarly,
	   <i>Delete Keys After Range</i> deletes all keys after the <i>From</i> frame.  In neither
	   case are the <i>To</i> or <i>From</i> frames deleted.</P>

    <P align=justify>
	   <i>Clear Motion</i> duplicates the function of Lightwave 5.6's Clear Motion feature in the
	   old Motion Graph.  All existing keyframes will be deleted, and a new, default keyframe
	   will be created.  Unlike 5.6's Clear Motion, this will only clear the channels marked at
	   the bottom of the interface.</P>
	   
	<P align=justify>If all keyframes become deleted in any of these modes, a new default keyframe is
	   created at frame 0 with a positon and rotation of 0.0 on all axes, and a scale of 1.0.</P>
	   
	<P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt="Thresholds Popup" border=0 height=125 src="Motify-Thresholds.jpg" width=61 hspace=15>
	   For more control in <i>Delete Key</i> and <i>Delete Within Range</i>, the <i>Threshold</i>
	   can be used.  <i>Threshold</i> determines how close a keyframe has to be to the <i>From</i> and <i>To</i>
	   frame numbers in order to be deleted.  The default value of 0.0 means that the key must exactly
	   match the frame numbers entered.  A value of 0.1 mean that any keyframe within 0.1 frames will be
	   deleted.  For example, if the you are trying to delete keyframe 20 with a <i>Threshold</i> of 0.1, 
	   all keys between the range of 19.9 throuhg 20.1 will be deleted.  A value of 0.5 can be used to ensure
	   that any fractional keys between the current frame and the next or previous frames are deleted with
	   going into the domain of the the next keyframe.  The pop-up to the right of the <i>Threshold</i>
	   field contains a number of reasonable presets for the threshold value.</P>

	<P align=justify>
	   The <i>Protection</i> pop-up can be used to ensure that certain important keyframes
	   are not deleted by <b>Mot-ify</b>, no matter what the <i>Delete Mode</i> or <i>To</i>/<i>From</i>
	   range are.  This is especially useful when deleting keys outside a range or clearing a motion,
	   where deleting all keyframes could ruin your scene or destroy your character's bone setup and IK poses.</P>

	<P align=justify>
       <IMG align=right alt="Protection Popup" border=0 height=95 src="Motify-Protect.jpg" width=118 hspace=15>
	   <i>No Protection</i> means that no keyframes will be protected from deletion.  This
	   allows you to delete any frame with <b>Mot-ify</b>.</P>
	
	<P align=justify><i>Protect Frame 0</i> will ensure that no keys at frame 0 are deleted.  Similarly,
	   <i>Protect Neg &amp; 0</i> will protect frame 0 and all negative keyframes.</P>

   	<P align=justify><i>Protect First Key</i> and <i>Protect Last Key</i> will keep <b>Mot-ify</b> from
	   deleting the first or last key in the channel, respectivly.</P>

   	<P align=justify>The <i>About</i> button will open the <i>About Mot-ify</i> panel, which contains
	   information about the plug-in and a list of keyboard equivilants that can be used.</p>

	<P align=justify>As with Delete Key, <b>Mot-ify</b> has buttons to enabled and disable individual
	   channels and groups of channels.  Only the selected channels will be processed.  You can click
	   the <i>Position</i>, <i>Rotation</i> and <i>Scale</i> buttons to toggle all the channels in
	   that group, and shift-click to invert that group's selection.</P>

	<P align=justify>The <i>All Other Channels</i> toggle is a very powerful feature, but can cause
	   a lot of damage to your scene if used incorrectly.  When you click on it, a message will appear
	   asking if you're really sure you want it enabled.  If you do, then all non-motion channels will
	   also be processed by <b>Mot-ify</b> (the <i>Position</i>, <i>Rotation</i> and <i>Scale</i> buttons
	   still determine if the motion channels are processed).  This includes all envelopes applied to
	   those items (like Camera Zoom Factor and Light Intensity), envelopes for applied plug-ins (such
	   as Morph Mixer channels), and surface envelopes applied in the Surface Editor.  <b>Use this feature
	   carefully</b>, especially when deleting keys on multiple items at once; in such cases <b>Mot-ify</b>
	   will ask you once more if you're really sure you want to do this.</P>

	<P align=justify>To begin processing, fill in the options you want and click <i>OK</i>.  In some of the
	   more time-consuming operations, such as clearing the motions of items and their children, or deleting
	   a range of keys in all items, <b>Mot-ify</b> will display a progress window while it works.</P>

	<H3 align=center>Limitations
	  <HR width=50%></H3>

	<P align=justify>The one thing that keeps <b>Mot-ify</b> from being a complete replacement for Delete
	   Key is edit field control.  LWPanels doesn't simulate Layout's handling of Return (which accepts the
	   value and closes the panel) and Enter (which acts like Tab, closing the panel after the last field).

	<P align=justify>You'll also notice that no edit fields are active when you open the panel, which means
	   you can't just call <b>Mot-ify</b>, typing in a value, and hit Return to continue.  This is again
	   due to how LWPanels handles edit fields.  It is possible to make the edit field enabled by default, but
	   this slows down quick deletion operations by requiring you to hit Enter more times to close the panel.

    <P align=justify>Instead I've opted to make <b>Mot-ify</b> immediatly available for quickly deleting
	   keys at the current time just by calling it and hitting Return or Enter, which probably covers 90% of
	   it's everyday use.  To enter a different time value, you'll have to first hit Tab to go to the first
	   edit field, or click in a field.</P>

    <H3 align=center><b>Revision History</b>
	  <HR width=50%></H3>
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>04-22-01</b>  Fixed another deep channel group bug that caused lock-ups in certain situations</li>
	    <li><b>02-12-01</b>  Fixed a bug that would cause Mot-ify to lock up (or rather, it would get stuck
		  in an endless loop) when scanning deep channel groups.  This was most obvious when deleting keys from
		  a ParticleFX emitter.</li>
	    <li><b>01-29-01</b>  <i>All Other Channels</i> will now also affect all other channel groups belonging
		  to an item, except for the bones of an object (which are, technically, channel groups of the object).
		  This allows <b>Mot-ify</b> to be used with to delete Morph Mixer keys and other keys within groups.</li>
	    <li><b>01-20-01</b>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Replaced the <i>Protect Frame 0</i> checkbox with the <i>Protection</i> pop-up</li>
			<li>The <i>Protection</i> mode is now remembered between activations, at least until Layout is quit.
			<li>Removed <i>Clear Motion Except Frame 0</i></li> and <i>Clear Motion After Frame 0</i>, since
			    those functions are now available from the <i>Protection</i> pop-up.</li>
		    <li>Added keyboard equivilants to open the About/Keys panel and change <i>Protection</i> modes</li>
		    <li>Fixed a bug where a new default frame was created at frame 0 if frame 0</li>
		  </ul>
	    <li><b>01-16-01</b>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Added <i>All Other Channels</i> toggle</li>
		    <li>Fixed the <i>All Items</i> <i>For</i> mode, which was previously ignoring unparented items.</li>
			<li>Fixed <i>About Box</i> title bar, removed some extra spacing and fixed a crash when scrolling
			    the Keyboard Equivilants List.</li>
		  </ul>
