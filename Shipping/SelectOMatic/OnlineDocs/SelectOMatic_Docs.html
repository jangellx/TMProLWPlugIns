	<br><STRONG>Select-O-Matic</STRONG> is a grouping and selection plug-in for
    Lightwave 7.5.  I provides improved item selection features as well as arbitrary
    grouping of items.  This plug-in requires Lightwave 7.5.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install ReplaceObjects, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy Select-O-Matic.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add ReplaceObjects.p. Layout should report that the plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>Select-O-Matic</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-ins will be
        the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>

	<P align=justify><STRONG>Select-O-Matic</STRONG>'s core is the Master plug-in of the same name.  This can
     be added directly from the Master plug-ins panel, or via the Select-O-Matic Properties generic plug-in.</P>

	<P align=justify>Initially, the properties panel shows the current selection.  This can be changed to show
     custom groups by clicking the <em>Groupings</em> button at the top of the panel.</p>

	<P align=justify>
     <IMG align=right alt="Sort Mode" border=0 height=64 src="SelectOMatic-Sort.jpg" width=98>
     How the list is sorted is determined by the <em>Sort</em> popup.  The list can be sorted in
     Natural order, Alphabetically, and when in <em>Groupings</em> mode, Manually by dragging around items within
     groups.</P>
     
	<P align=justify>
     <IMG align=right alt="Select-O-Matic Group Menu" border=0 height=109 src="SelectOMatic-Groupings.jpg" width=221>
     <em>Groupings</em> allow the creation of selection sets of items.  An item can belong to multiple
     groups, and any combination of items can be in any group.  Groups can also have sub-groups.  Items can be moved
     between groups by simple drag and drop, and can be sorted in the same way when <em>Sort</em> is set to Manual.
     
  <P align=justify>You can create a new group by right-clicking in the group list and selecting <em>Create Group</em>
     from the menu.  You can also remove or rename existing groups from here.  <em>Add selected items in Layout to
     group</em> will add all selected items to the current group.  You can also remove items selected in the list
     from the groups they belong to.</P>

  <P align=justify>The yellow block to the left of one of the groups marks it as the current group.  Similarly, the
     black dot marks an item as the current item.  These are used as the starting point by the navigation generics.
     You can click in this column to directly set the current group or item.</P>

  <p align=center><IMG alt="Select-O-Matic Selection Interface" border=0 height=576 src="SelectOMatic-Select.jpg" width=218></p>
  
  <P align=justify>
     The Selection Tools button toggles the selection controls on and off.  The <em>Mode</em> popup
     determines if this palette will selected, deselect or add to the current selection or invert the selection of
     items that match when the Execute button is clicked.  The <em>Match</em> popup allows for specific comparisons to be
     made based on item name.  The <em>Skip</em>/<em>Keep</em> fields allow you to skip some number of items, and then
     keep another count of items.  For example, a skip of one and a keep of 2 would skip one item, keep two, skip another
     item, keep two more, and so on.  The <em>Random</em> field allows a random number of the items to be selected
     out of the total number of matches.  The closer this is to 100%, the more items will be selected.  Once you have
     entered the appropriate settings, click the Execute button to perform it.  It's best to be in the Selection display
     mode so you can see the effects immediately.</P>
     

  <P align=justify>
     The <em>Fetch</em> button will simply refresh the selected items list.  This is usually done automatically,
     so you'll likely not need to use this button.</P>

	Navigation Generics<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

        or the next or previous item, depending on which is after the current item in the list.
