UberNull is a simple program that parents every object, camera, bone
and light that is not already parented to an UberNull.  This is
useful for creating setups and assemblies, where it is useful to have
everything parented to a single, easy to manage null object.

Argument Template:

	UberNull ?
		Gets help on how to use UberNull

	UberNull <scene.lws>
		<scene.lws> is the name of the scene file to UberNullify

UberNull takes the scene file provided and generates a new scene file
called <scene>-UberNull.lws in the same directory.  The new scene
contains a null object called --UberNull--<scene> as the first object,
in the scene, to which everything that was previously unparented is
now parented to.


-- Important Notes:

- UberNull DOES NOT MODIFY the original scene.  It creates a new scene
  ending in -UberNull. Thus there is no risk of UberNull destroying your
  original scene.

- UberNull SHOULD work on all bones, objects, lights and cameras.
  However, it may not work on verions of Lightwave before or after
  5.6.  It will almost certainly not work with Lightwave 6.0 due to
  what may be a drastically different file format.
