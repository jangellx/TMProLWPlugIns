	<br><STRONG>Nullify</STRONG> is a 
	  plug-in for Lightwave 6.0 or greater. It replaces all selected objects with nulls, can
	  add a prefix or suffix to the name, or clear the bones from those objects, and adjust
	  the shadow options.  This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>
	
	<P align=justify>To install Nullify, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy Nullify.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add Nullify.p. Layout should report that one plug-in has been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        <STRONG>Nullify</STRONG> plug-in from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign it to a key 
        or button on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-in will be
		the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>

	<P align=justify>To use <STRONG>Nullify</STRONG>,
       you must first select the objects you want to convert to nulls.  All selected objects will
	   be nullified.  Once you have selected the appropriate objects, launch <b>Nullify</b>.  You should
	   see an interface simlar to the one shown above.  The <i>About</i> button, as you'd expect,
	   presents information about the plug-in.</P>

	<P align=justify>All of the settings in the interface are optional.  If you don't want to use
	   them, just click <i>OK</i> to continue.  In this default state, all the selected objects
	   will simply be converted into nulls.</P

	<P align=justify>If <i>Store Original Names</i> is checked, the original object name will be stored
     as a tag in the scene file.  You van view tags with the Comments Generic plug-in included with
     Lightwave.  <b>Nullify</b> writes tags that are compatible with <b>Replace Objects</b>, allowing
     you to use the <b>Replace With Original Object</b> plug-in to reload the original item.
     The tag starts with the keyword "OriginalItem", then a 0 if it was a null or a 1 if it was an
     object, and finally the path to the object, or the original name of the null object.  If this
     tag already exists for this object, it will be replaced with the new tag.  If this option is left
     unchecked, then no tags will be modified or created.</P>

	<P align=justify>You can add a prefix or a suffix to the object's name after it has been
	   converted to a null via the <i>Prefix</i> and <i>Suffix</i> fields.  The new null object's
	   name will start with the prefix, then contain the original object name, and finally end
	   in the suffix.</P>

	<P align=justify>If <i>Nullify Descendants</i> is enabled, then all children of the selected items
	   will also be converted to nulls using the panel's settings</P>

	<P align=justify>When <i>Remove Bones</i> is enabled, any bones in the nullified objects will be
	   cleared.  In most cases the bones are no longer nessesary once the object has become a null.
	   However, there are cases where expressions, plug-ins or <i>Use Bones From Object</i>, where
	   you may want the bones to remain</P>

	<P align=justify>If <i>Disable Shadow Options</i> is enabled, the <i>Cast Shadow</i>, <i>Receive
	   Shadow</i> and <i>Self Shadow</i> options are disabled.  This has been reported to reduce render
	   times, even on nulls.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Remove Moprh Mixer</i> will remove any instances of Morph Mixer applied to any of
     the objects being nullified if checked.</P>

	<P align=justify>Clicking <i>OK</i> will use the settings in the panel to convert objects into nulls.
	   It will also store the interface settings until Layout is quit, allowing you to quickly nullify
	   smaller groups of objects successivly.  <i>Cancel</i> will exit Nullify without performing any
	   changes to your scene.</P>
