	<br><STRONG>AlphaObjects</STRONG> is a 
	  plug-in for Lightwave 6.0 or greater. It allows you to quicky and easily
    create alpha-only objects for a variety of situations, including shadow
    catchers and matte objects.  This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install AlphaObjects, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy AlphaObjects.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add AlphaObjects.p. Layout should report that two plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>AlphaObjects</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-ins will be
        the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>

	<br>
	<P><STRONG>AlphaObjects</STRONG> includes the following plugins:</P>

	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="AlphaObjects"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Alpha Objects<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

  <p align=center><IMG alt="Alpha Objects Interface" border=0 height=535 src="AlphaObjects-Main.jpg" width=473></p>
	
 	<P align=justify>The <b>Alpha Objects</b> generic plug-in is the core of this package.  It
  actually creates new objects with different alphas. To use <b>Alpha Objects</b>, you must
  first select the objects you want to affect.  Once you have some selected, activating the
  plug-in will open an interface like the one above.</P>

 	<P align=justify>
  <IMG align=right alt="Limit To Popup" border=0 height=50 src="AlphaObjects-LimitTo.jpg" width=206 hspace=15>
  The <em>Limit To</em> popup allows you to batch modify all surfaces of all selected objects,
  or just select surfaces of a single object.</P>  

 	<P align=justify>
  <!--IMG align=right alt="Sort By Popup" border=0 height=50 src="../../Images/Products/AlphaObjects-SortBy.jpg" width=68 hspace=15-->
  The <em>Sort By</em> popup can be used to sort the items by name or by their new alpha mode.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  <IMG align=right alt="Surface As Popup" border=0 height=290 src="AlphaObjects-SurfaceAs.jpg" width=343 hspace=15>
  The currently selected entry in the list can have it's alpha mode changed by using the <em>Surface
  As</em> popup.  As well as performing no change and selecting from a number of presets, you can
  select as specific surface to replace the others.  Although there is the illusion of multiple
  selection in the list, multi-select doesn't actually work due to limitations to LWPanels.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  When the <em>From Surface</em> mode is selected, the <em>Surface File</em> field can be used to
  pick a .srf file.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  <!--IMG align=right alt="Suffix With Popup" border=0 height=289 src="lphaObjects-Preset.jpg" width=171 hspace=15-->
  The <em>Output Path</em> field is used to set a common path to output all the newly created alpha
  objects to.  If this is blank, the objects will be created in the same directoy as the originals.
  These objects will have a suffix added to the end of their name based on the <em>Suffix With</em>
  field.  The popup to it's right allows you to select from a number of presets, including custom
  presets created with <strong>Alpha Objects Config</strong>.  Selecting an entry from this popup
  will set all the fields.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  By default, the new alpha objects will be written to disk, but the original objects will stay in the
  scene.  If <em>Replace currently load objects with new objects</em> is checked, the new alpha objects
  will be loaded in place of those in the scene file.
  </P>


	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="AlphaObjects Config"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Alpha Objects Config<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

  <p align=center><IMG alt="Alpha Objects Config" border=0 height=514 src="AlphaObjects-Config.jpg" width=762></p>

 	<P align=justify>
  <strong>Alpha Objects Config</strong> can be used to customize the the presets popup list.  The
  entries in the list represent different presets, which are shown in the preset popup by suffix.
  The leftmost column represents the generic plug-in that this preset maps to.  The second column
  is the mode, followed by the output path and the suffix of the generated file.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  The buttons on the right of the list allow dividers to be inserted and removed, and allow entries
  to be shifted up and down the list.
  </P>

 	<P align=justify>
  By default, the configuration file is stored on the local machine, but larger studios can share
  the config using the <em>Config From</em> popup and the <em>Shared Config Path</em>.  The settings
  can be reloaded using the <em>Reload</em> button.
  </p>

 	<br><HR width="90%">
	<H3 align=center>Replacement Generics<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

 	<P align=justify>
  Also included are a series of preset replacement generics, plus a dozen user replacement generics.
  These replace the existing file with another of the same name in the same directory, but with a
  different suffix, thus allowing quick swaps between the original objects and various alpha objects.
  The suffixs match those set in <strong>Alpha Objects Configure</strong>
