	<br><STRONG>ReplaceObjects</STRONG> is a 
	  plug-in for Lightwave 6.0 or greater. It allows you to replace multiple
    objects with multiple other objects.  The replacement can be from a random
    selection of objects and weighted for more control, and the original object's
    name and path can be stored as scene tags so you can return to the original
    at any time.  Two plug-ins are included, 
	  <A href="#RepalceObjects"><STRONG>Replace Objects</STRONG></A> and
	  <A href="#ReplaceWithOriginalObject"><STRONG>Replace With Original Object</STRONG></A>.
	  This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install ReplaceObjects, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy ReplaceObjects.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add ReplaceObjects.p. Layout should report that two plug-ins have been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>ReplaceObjects</STRONG> plug-ins from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign them to keys 
        or buttons on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.   The plug-ins will be
        the prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the 
        Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>
	<br>
	<P><STRONG>ReplaceObjects</STRONG> includes the following plugins:</P>

	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#ReplaceObjects"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Replace Objects<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>
	
  <p align=center><IMG alt="Replace Objects Interface" border=0 height=515 src="ReplaceObjects-Main.jpg" width=400></p>

 	<P align=justify><b>Replace Objects</b> allows you to replace any or all objects in the
  scene with any other objects.  These replacements are randomly selected from the swap list
  based on each's weight.  You use the plug-in by selecting the objects you want to replace,
  activating the <b>Replace Objects</b>, selecting any number of swap objects and their
  weights, and hitting <i>OK</i> to replace the selected objects with the swaps.</p>

 	<P align=justify>To use <b>Replace Objects</b>, you must first select the objects you want
  to replace.  Once you have some selected, activating the plug-in will open an interface
  like the one above.</P>
  
 	<P align=justify>
  <IMG align=right alt="Limit To Popup" border=0 height=50 src="ReplaceObjects-LimitTo.jpg" width=121 hspace=15>
  The <i>Limit To</i> pop-up determines if all objects will be replaced, or
  only the selected objects.</P>

 	<P align=justify>The core of the plug-in is the <i>Swap List</i>.  This contains a list of all
  the swap objects you have entered.  The first column of the list shows a check if the item is
  enabled, and you can click in this column to change this state.  The second column is the
  filename of the swap object.  The third column displays the weight of this swap object.  The
  final column shows the probability of this object being chosen as a replacement.  Adding together
  all the values in this column will total 100%.  Disabled items will not contribute to this total,
  and will display a dash instead.</P>

 	<P align=justify>
  <IMG align=right alt="Sort By Popup" border=0 height=50 src="ReplaceObjects-SortBy.jpg" width=74 hspace=15>
  The <i>Sort By</i> pop-up allows you to sort the swap list alphabetically
  by object name or by weight.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Add</i> will add a new swap object to the list.  <i>Clone</i> will duplicate
  the selected swap object.  <i>Remove</i> will remove a swap object, and <i>Clear All</i> will
  remove all swap objects and clear the list.</P>

 	<P align=justify>The <i>Object Path</i> field contains the path of the swap object.  You can click
  the button to the right of the field to open a file requester to select the object.  If no path
  is entered, the <i>Swap List</i> will display (original object), meaning that if this swap object
  is chosen, the object won't be replaced.</P>

 	<P align=justify>The <i>Weight</i> field allows you to adjust the weight of the selected swap
  object.  By default, all objects have a weight of 1.0, which means they all have an equal chance
  of being chosen as a replacement object.  An object with a weight of 2.0 has twice as much chance
  of being chosen as an object with a 1.0 weight.  You can see these weights as a percentage in
  the <i>Swap List</i>.</P>

 	<P align=justify>The <i>Enable</i> checkbox allows you to enable or disable a particular item.
  If an item is disabled, it will act as if it wasn't there, allowing you to temporarilly ignore
  unessesary items.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Store Original Object Name As Tag</i> will keep a copy of the original object
  name as a scene tag.  Scene tags can be viewed using the Comments Generic plug-in include with
  Lightwave.  Storing the original object names allows you to use the <b>Replace With Original
  Object</b> plug-in to reload the original item. The tag starts with the keyword "OriginalItem",
  then a 0 if it was a null or a 1 if it was an object, and finally the path to the object, or the
  original name of the null object.  If this tag already exists for this object, it will be replaced
  with the new tag.  If this option is left unchecked, then no tags will be modified or created.</P>

  <P align=justify><i>Save</i> can be used to store the current swap list to disk for later use as
  an .RPS file.  You can load these settings back in with the <i>Load</i> button.</P>
  
  <P align=justify><i>About</i>, as you'd expect, will pop up some information about this plug-in.</P>

  <P align=justify>Once you have all the options set up, <i>OK</i> will begin replacing objects.
  A progress bar will show you how the replacement is going.  If you don't want to perform the
  replacement, you can hit <i>Cancel</i> instead.</P>

 	<br><HR width="90%">
	<a name="#ReplaceWithOriginalObject"></a>
	<H3 align=center>Replace With Original Object<br>
	<HR width="40%"></H3>

  <P align=justify>This plug-in reverses the effects of <b>Nullify</b> and <b>Replace Objects</b> when
  <i>Store Original Object Name As Tag</i> was enabled.  It replaces each selected object with the
  object or null object specified by the "OriginalItem" tag.  The existing tag will then be replaced
  with the original name of the item we're replacing, so you can call this over and over again to swap
  between the orignal item and the replacement.  If the tag doesn't exist, then this will do nothing.</P>
