	<br><STRONG>Key Strainer</STRONG>
	  is a keyframe reduction plug-in for Lightwave 6 or greater.  It provides various methods for reducing the number of keys
    on the channels of items in a scene.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install <b>Key Strainer</b>, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy KeyStrainer.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add KeyStrainer.p. Layout should report that one plug-in has been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        <STRONG>Key Strainer</STRONG> plug-in from 
        the Generics pop-up in the Plug-in Options Panel, or assign it to a key 
        or button on the interface with Configure Keys and Configure Menus.  Please 
        refer to your Lightwave documentation for more information.  The plug-in will be
    		prefixed with TM_P under the Plugins heading of the Configure Keys and Configure Menus panels.</LI>
	</UL>
	<br>

	<P align=justify>The basic <STRONG>Key Strainer</STRONG> interface looks very similar to <strong>Mot-ify</strong>
    and the delete key panel built into Lightwave.  After launching it, you should see an interface like this:</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Interface" border=0 height=213 src="KeyStrainer-Main-Kill.jpg" width=458></p>

	<P align=justify>At the top of the interface is the reduction range.  All frames between the low and high frames will be reduced.</P>

	<P align=justify>
     <IMG align=right alt ="Reduction Modes" border=0 height=65 hspace=15 src="KeyStrainer-Modes.jpg" width=115 >
    There are three reduction modes in <STRONG>Key Strainer</STRONG>.  The interface above shows the <em>Keep/Kill Step</em> mode.
    This is a very simple:  It skips over a certain number of keyframes, and deletes a certain number of keyframes, repeating this down the range.
    This is most useful when the channel has a keyframe at every frame, since this only looks at the number of keys and not their times.</P>

	<P align=justify>When using <em>Keep/Kill Step</em> mode, you can enter the number of keys to skip in the <em>Keep Step</em> field, and the number of
    keys you want to delete in the <em>Kill Step</em> field.  If you enter a Keep of 2 and a Kill of 3, then <strong>Key Strainer</strong> will skip
    two keys, delete three keys, skip two keys, and so on.</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Interface" border=0 height=213 src="KeyStrainer-Main-Smart.jpg" width=458></p>

 	<P align=justify>
     <IMG align=right alt ="Keys As" border=0 height=95 hspace=15 src="KeyStrainer-Spline.jpg" width=80 >
    The highest quality reduction mode is <em>Smart Freeze</em>, shown above.  This will bake the channel, and then intelligently remove
    keyframes based on the <em>Threshold</em> value.  The higher this value, the fewer keys there will be.  If <em>Freeze Modifiers</em> is checked,
    channel modifiers will also be baked and their keyframes will be reduced.  You can pick they spline type for the generated keys with the
    <em>Keys As</em>. Note that Bezier and TCB values will be set to their defaults, but the different interpolations will still determine how
    the keys are reduced.<p>
  
    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Interface" border=0 height=211 src="KeyStrainer-Main-Stepped.jpg" width=456></p>

 	<P align=justify>The final mode, <em>Stepped Freeze</em>, is really just a more flexible baker.  It will create a baked motion with a keyframe
    every frame as determined by the <em>Frame Step</em> field.  If <em>Freeze Modifiers</em> is checked, channel modifiers will also be baked and
    their keyframes will be reduced.  You can pick they spline type for the generated keys with the <em>Keys As</em>. Note that Bezier and TCB values
    will be set to their defaults.<p>

 	<P align=justify>To the right of the reduction mode popup is a <em>Preview</em> button.  When enabled, a preview of a single channel will fill
    the bottom of the interface as shown below, allowing you to get an idea of what the reduction will do to your channels before reducing the.
    You can turn on and off the orignal or reduced curves or keys using the checkboxes above the preview. The reduced curve is drawn purple with
    white keys, while the original curve is drawn black with red keys. You can pick which channel you want to preview using the channel list at
    the bottom of the panel.</P>

    <p align=center><IMG alt="Content Director Interface" border=0 height=577 src="KeyStrainer-Preview.jpg" width=456></p>

  <P align=justify>
     <IMG align=right alt ="For" border=0 height=95 hspace=15 src="KeyStrainer-For.jpg" width=195 >
     The <i>For</i> pop-up is identical to that in Motify, and allows you to pick what
     items will be affected by the reduction.</P>

 	<P align=justify>As with Delete Key and <b>Mot-ify</b>, <strong>Key Strainer</strong> has buttons
     to enabled and disable individual channels and groups of channels.  Only the selected channels
     will be processed.  You can click the <i>Position</i>, <i>Rotation</i> and <i>Scale</i> buttons
     to toggle all the channels in that group, and shift-click to invert that group's selection.</P>

	<P align=justify>The <i>All Other Channels</i> toggle is a very powerful feature, but can cause
	   a lot of damage to your scene if used incorrectly.  When you click on it, a message will appear
	   asking if you're really sure you want it enabled.  If you do, then all non-motion channels will
	   also be processed by <b>Key Strainer</b> (the <i>Position</i>, <i>Rotation</i> and <i>Scale</i> buttons
	   still determine if the motion channels are processed).  This includes all envelopes applied to
	   those items (like Camera Zoom Factor and Light Intensity), envelopes for applied plug-ins (such
	   as Morph Mixer channels), and surface envelopes applied in the Surface Editor.  <b>Use this feature
	   carefully</b>, especially when deleting keys on multiple items at once; in such cases <bKey Strainer</b>
	   will ask you once more if you're really sure you want to do this.</P>

	<P align=justify>To begin processing, fill in the options you want and click <i>OK</i>.  A progress window
     will show you the reduction process while it <strong>Key Strainer</strong> works.  Remember that this
     operation isn't undoable, so you might want to make sure you've saved your scene first and made sure you
     have the options set correctly.</P>
