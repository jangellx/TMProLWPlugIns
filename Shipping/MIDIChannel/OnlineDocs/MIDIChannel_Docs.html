	<br><STRONG>MIDIChannel</STRONG> is a 
	  channel handelr plug-in for Lightwave 6.0 or greater. It allows you to
    drive animation channels with the information from a MIDI file.
    This plug-in requires Lightwave 6.0 or greater.</P>

	<P align=justify>To install MIDIChannel, just follow these steps:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>If any copies of Layout are running, quit them now.
	  <LI>Create a new directory in your Lightwave Plugins directory called TMPro and copy MIDIChannel.p into it.
	  <LI>Load Layout
	  <LI>Select Add Plug-ins.
	  <LI>Find and add MIDIChannel.p. Layout should report that one plug-in has been added.
	  <LI>Quit Layout. This will update your Lightwave 
        config and ensure that everything works properly. 
        <LI>The next time you run Layout, you can launch 
        the <STRONG>MIDIChannel</STRONG> plug-in from the Modifiers tab
        of the Graph Editor.  Please refer to your Lightwave documentation
        for more information.</LI>

  <p align=center><IMG alt="MIDI Channel Interface" border=0 height=447 src="MIDICHannel-Main.jpg" width=314></p>

 	<P align=justify><b>MIDI Channel</b> allows you to use the information from a MIDI file
  to drive your animation.  Upon applying <b>MIDI Channel</b> to a channel in Layout's
  Graph Editor and double-clicking it's entry, it will open an interface similar to the
  one above.  All of the controls will be ghosted until you select a MIDI file via the
  <i>MIDI File</i> button.

 	<P align=justify>After loading a MIDI file, the you will want to pick a <i>Track</i> and
  a <i>Channel</i>.  There can be any number of tracks in a MIDI file, and up to 16 channels
  per track.  <b>MIDI Channel</b> supports all Format 0, 1 and 2 MIDI file formats.  Note
  that first track of Format 1 MIDI files is a special tempo track and does not contain any
  note information.</P>
  
  <P align=justify>
  <IMG align=right alt="Paremeter Popup" border=0 height=50 src="MIDICHannel-Parameter.jpg" width=103 hspace=15>
  The <i>Parameter</i> pop-up determines the kind of data this channel will
  handle.  This can be either Note On/Off events or Note Velocity (how quickly the note was
  pressed or released).  MIDI notes and velocities have a range of 0 to 127.  Normally, notes
  can overloap in a MIDI file, but this is impossible in an animation channel, which can only
  display a single value at a time.  Thus <b>MIDI Channel</b> displays only the most recently
  "On" note at a particular time, skipping "Off" events if there are any notes still playing.
  You can adjust the range of notes using other options described below to limit this effect.</P>
  
 	<P align=justify><i>Start Time</i> shifts the start time of the MIDI file in a similar manner
  to how you can shift the start time of imagse sequences in the Image Editor.  If set to one
  second, the MIDI file won't start the Layout time is at one second.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Value Offset</i> allows you to shift the values returned by <b>MIDI Channel</b>.
  This occurs after <i>Value Scale</i> has been applied. Note that if this plug-in is applied to a
  rotation channel, it returns values in radians, not degrees.  There are 57.295 radians (180/pi)
  per degree, should you want to do the conversion.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Value Scale</i> allows you to scale the values returned by <b>MIDI Channel</b>.
  The scale factor is applied before <i>Value Offset</i>.</P>

 	<P align=justify>If <i>Additive</i> is checked, the values returned by <b>MIDI Channel</b> are added
  to the existing channel's values.  If disabled, then the plug-in will replace the original data.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Low Note</i> and <i>High Note</i> allow you to narrow the range of the notes
  that the plug-in will output to the aniamtion channel.  You can use this to create a player piano
  by limited the Low and High range to the same value, incrementing it for each successive key on
  the keyboard.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Parameter Shift</i> acts just like <i>Value Offset</i>, but occurs before
  <i>Value Scale</i>.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Parameter Off Level</i> allows you to set the "off", meaning the value the
  graph will have when no notes are playing.</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Parameter Decay</i> lets you adjust how long it takes for a note to die out
  after the key has been released (ie: a "Note Off" event has occured).</P>

 	<P align=justify><i>Parameter On Ease</i> lets you adjust how long it takes for a note to go
  from an off state to a completely on state, acting as a ramping effect leading up to the "Note On"
  event at the end of the ramp.</P>

 	<P align=justify>The <i>About</i> button gives you some information about the plug-in.</P>
