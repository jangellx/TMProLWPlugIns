UberNull 1.5 -- TM Productions -- http://www.tmproductions.com

UberNull is a simple program that parents every object, camera, bone
and light that is not already parented to an UberNull.  This is
useful for creating setups and assemblies, where it is useful to have
everything parented to a single, easy to manage null object.

Argument Template:

	UberNull ?
		Gets help on how to use UberNull

	UberNull <scene.lws> -o(utput) <output.lws> -n(ull) <null name> -l(oc)
                 <FIRST or LAST>

		<scene.lws>
			The name of the scene file to UberNullify
		-o(utput) <output.lws>
			The name of the newly created, UberNull'ed scene.
			If not specified, the a new scene will be created
			in the same directory called <scene>-UberNull.lws
		-n(ull) <null name>
			The name of the UberNull object.  If not specified,
			it will be named --UberNull--<scene>.
		-l(oc) <FIRST or LAST>
			This creates the UberNull as either the First or
			Last object in the scene.  If not specified, the
			object will be created as the First in the scene

UberNull takes the scene file provided and generates a new scene file
with the name you specify.  The new scene contains a null object called
whatever you like as the first object or last object in the scene, to
which everything that was previously unparented is now parented to.

Examples:
	UberNull MyScene.lws -o UberNulled.lws -n Uberific -l LAST
		This will create an UberNull named Uberific as the last
		object in the scene UberNulled.lws, to which all of the
		unparented items in MyScene.lws will be parented.

	UberNull MyScene.lws
		Creates a new scene called MyScene-UberNull.lws, with
		all items from MyScene.lws parented to a null called
		UberNull as the first object in the scene.

			
-- Important Notes:

- UberNull DOES NOT MODIFY the original scene.  It creates a new scene
  ending in -UberNull. Thus there is no risk of UberNull destroying your
  original scene.

- UberNull SHOULD work on all bones, objects, lights and cameras.
  However, it may not work on verions of Lightwave before or after
  5.6.  It will almost certainly not work with Lightwave 6.0 due to
  what may be a drastically different file format.
