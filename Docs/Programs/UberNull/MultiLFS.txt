MultiLFS 1.0 -- TM Productions -- http://www.tmproductions.com

MultiLFS stand form Multiple Load-From-Scene.  It's purpose is to load
multiple instances of one scene into another scene, similar to the 
Load From Scene feature of Lightwave.  Unlike Lightwave's Load From
Scene, you can load in as many instances of the load-from scene as
you like.


Argument Template:

	MultiLFS ?
		Gets help on how to use UberNull

	MultiLFS <source.lws> <lfs.lws> <count> [-o <output>] [-lights] 
                 <FIRST or LAST>

		<source.lws>
			The name of the scene file to load into
		<lfs.lws>
			The name of the scene to Load From Scene from
		<count>
			The number of times to Loaad From Scene
		[-o(utput) <output.lws>]
			The name of the newly created, MultiLFS'ed scene.
			If not specified, the a new scene will be created
			in the same directory called <scene>-MultiLFSed.lws
		[-lights]
			Load lights as well as objects


MultiLFS takes the source scene provided and creates a new output scene.
It copies the source scene into the output, and adds the objects and
optionally the lights from the load-from scene the number of times
specified.  

Examples:
	MultiLFS tree.lws bird.lws 6
		Creates a new scene called tree-MultiLFSed.lws containing
		the scene tree.lws and six copies of bird.lws

	MultiLFS valley.lws soldier.lws 20 -o valley_with_troops.lws -lights
		Creates a new scene called valley_with_troops.lws containing
		the original valley scene plus the contents fo twenty solider
		scenes, as well as the lights from those scenes.


-- Important Notes:

- MultiLFS DOES NOT MODIFY the original scene.  It creates a new scene
  ending in -MultiLFSed if no output is specified. Thus there is no risk
  of MultiLFS destroying your original scene.

- The current version of MultiLFS SHOULD work on all bones, objects,
  lights and cameras.  However, it may not work on verions of Lightwave
  before or after 5.6.  It will almost certainly not work with Lightwave
  6.0 due to what may be a drastically different file format.
