--- How to get the TM Productions project files to compile ------

This document explains how to set up the TM Productions source code to compile on the
Intel and Alpha platforms.  It is assumed that you have VSS and MSVC++ 5.0 or 6.0
installed, and that you've already gotten latest and setup your working folders.

- DIRECTORY STRUCTURE -------------------------------------------
The directory structure is set up as follows:

- Bin          Executable binary files.  You can check these in if you want; either
                 way they will get overwritten when you recompile.
  - AXP        Alpha-platform Windows/MS-DOS compiles
    - Debug    Debug versions of Alpha executables
    - Release  Release versions of Alpha executables
  - x86        Intel-platform Windows/MS-DOS compiles
    - Debug    Debug versions of Intel executables
    - Release  Release versions of Intel executables
- Docs         Documentation for the programs, as provided for the end user.
  - Programs   Documentation for executable programs, as provided for end users.
                 Each program should have it's own directory.
  - Libraries  Documentation for programmers on how to use linker libraries within
               programs.
- Lib          Some linker libraries can be found here, and others don'r.  Use this
                 if you need it.  As with Binaries, these will be overwritten when
                 you recompile.
  - AXP        Alpha-platform Windows/MS-DOS compiles
    - Debug    Debug versions of Alpha linker libraries
    - Release  Release versions of Alpha linker libraries
  - x86        Intel-platform Windows/MS-DOS compiles
    - Debug    Debug versions of Intel linker libraries
    - Release  Release versions of Intel linker libraries
- LightwaveSDK The Lightwave Plug-in SDK from NewTek, slightly modified
  - doc	       Lightwave SDK documentation
  - include    Lightwave SDK includes
  - lib        Lightwave SDK linker libraries
  - sample     Sample Lightwave Plug-ins
  - source     Lightwave linker library source
  - support    Lightwave SDK support files
- Projects     MSVC++ Projects that, when compiled, become linker libraries
  - Lightwave  Lightwave linker libraries
  - Portable   Portable linker libraries, containing no platform-specific code, or
                 code that is #ifdef'ed for different platforms
- Shipping     Final release versions of programs, including all executables,
                 installers and documentation the end user may require.  Each
                 program should have it's own directory.
- Workspaces   MSVC++ Workspaces and their specific projects that, when compiled,
                 become executable programs or plug-ins for other programs.
  - Lightwave  Lightwave plug-ins and stand-alone programs
  - Portable   Entirely prortable programs.  Generally these are programs that only
                 run from the command line.

- SETUP MSVC++ --------------------------------------------------
All projects were created with MSVC++ 5.0 or 6.0, so be sure you have one of these.

Required Setup:

- Run MSVC++
- Select the menu item Tools/Options
- Click the Directories Tab
  - Add the following Include paths:
    - <working dir>\Projects
    - <working dir>\LightwaveSDK\include
    For example, f:\TMProductions_SourceTree\Projects
  - Add the following Directory paths:
    - <working dir>\Lib
    - <working dir>\LightwaveSDK\lib
    For example, f:\TMProductions_SourceTree\Lib
- Click the Source Options tab
  - Enable "Check out source file(s) when edited", if you like.  If deselected, you
      will have to manually check out files before editing.
  - Disable "Check in files when closing the workspace".  This should NOT be active,
      since if you quit MSVC++ for the night and have only partially completed your
      changes, unfinished code will be entered into the database.
  - Everything else do what you like with.
- Other Suggestions
  - Under the InfoViewer tab, enable "Always syncronize topic and TOC".  You'll know
      why this is good when you need it.
  - Under the Format tab, change the colors to:
    - Comments:    Foreground dark blue, background yellow
    - Numbers:     Foreground dark blue, background automatic
    - Strings:     Foreground red, background automatic
  - Under the Tabs tab:
    - Select C/C++ from the File Type pop-up.
    - Change the Tab Size and Indent Size to 2.  All my code is set to 2.
    - Turn on Insert Spaces.  This keeps the coding looking the same no matter what
        the tab size is set to.

You should now be able to compile all programs and linker libraries.

- Using linker libraries in workspaces ---------------------------
The easiest way to add a library to a program is to insert the library into the
program's workspace, and set the library's project as a dependancy of the program's
project.

For example, you have a workspace called Test.  It includes the project Test, which
compiles into a
