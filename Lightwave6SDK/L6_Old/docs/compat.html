<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>This is where we discuss version and compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Inspire, VTNT LW</p>

<p>Each release of LightWave since the introduction of the plug-in architecture has
enhanced the capabilities of the plug-in interface. Classes and globals are added and
some server structures are extended. Version numbers for the server classes distinguish
the different capabilities. Extended globals get new names in each release.</p>

<p>These design components combine to produce a plug-in architecture that enables existing
plug-ins to continue to function without change--indeed, without even the need to recompile
--as LightWave's plug-in interface is endowed with new features. This is important; plug-in
developers can take advantage of new interface capabilities at their liesure, while their
plug-ins continue to function.</p>

<p>The version number for all classes in release 4.0 was 1. In 5.0 many of the handler classes
(and their associated interface classes) were bumped up to version 2. In LightWave 5.5, the
version for anything new is 3. When Layout activates a handler, it first tries passing
version 3. If the server only supports a version 1 or 2 interface, then its activation function
should return AFUNC_BADVERSION, and Layout will try version 2 and finally version 1.</p>
