    <h3>Common Elements</h3>
    <p>The <em>host</em> is the program, either Layout or Modeler, that runs your plug-ins.</p>
    <p>A plug-in <em>module</em> is a file, usually with a <tt>.p</tt> extension, that
    contains one or more LightWave plug-ins. Any number of plug-ins can be compiled together
    into a single module--it's common for an image loader and an image saver to be together in
    the same file, for example.</p>
    <p>Every plug-in file needs a <em>server description</em> that lists the plug-ins in the
    file, and every plug-in needs a special entry point function, its <em>activation function</em>.
    Both of these are defined in the <a href="../include/lwserver.h">lwserver.h</a> header
    file. Each plug-in file also contains initialization and cleanup functions called <tt>Startup</tt>
    and <tt>Shutdown</tt>.</p>
    <p><b>Server Description</b></p>
    <p>The server description lists what your plug-in file contains. It's the first thing the
    host examines when it loads your module. The list appears in your source code as an array
    of ServerRecords.</p>
    <pre>
   typedef struct st_ServerRecord {
      const char     *className;
      const char     *name;
      ActivateFunc   *activate;
      ServerUserName *userNames;
   } ServerRecord;</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>className</tt></dt>
      <dd>A string containing the class of the plug-in. The class identifies what kind of plug-in
        this is, for example, &quot;ItemMotionHandler&quot; or &quot;ImageSaver&quot;. See the <a
        href="classes.html">Classes</a> document for a complete list of class names and
        descriptions.</dd>
      <dt><tt>name</tt></dt>
      <dd>A string containing the name by which LightWave will uniquely identify your plug-in.
        This is the name LightWave uses internally and saves in scene and object files. It's also
        the name displayed to the user if the plug-in doesn't supply a list of <tt>userNames</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt>activate</tt></dt>
      <dd>The activation function.</dd>
      <dt><tt>userNames</tt></dt>
      <dd>An array of plug-in names in different languages. This is the name that will be
        displayed to your users in LightWave's interface. Each string contains a version of the
        name in a different language. The language is given by an associated code page identifier.
        This field is optional, as are the languages you choose to support.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The userNames field is an array of ServerUserName structures.</p>
    <pre>
   typedef struct st_ServerUserName {
      const char *userName;
      long        langID;
   } ServerUserName;</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>userName</tt></dt>
      <dd>A string containing the locale-specific name of the plug-in. Japanese strings should be
        encoded as JIS on Windows and EUC on Unix.</dd>
      <dt><tt>name</tt></dt>
      <dd>A code indicating the language for the name string. A partial list:<blockquote>
          <tt><p>0x0407 LANGID_GERMAN<br>
          0x0409 LANGID_USENGLISH<br>
          0x0809 LANGID_UKENGLISH<br>
          0x040a LANGID_SPANISH<br>
          0x040c LANGID_FRENCH<br>
          0x0410 LANGID_ITALIAN<br>
          0x0411 LANGID_JAPANESE<br>
          0x0419 LANGID_RUSSIAN<br>
          0x041D LANGID_SWEDISH</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><b>Activation Function</b> </p>
    <p>The activation function is the entry point for the service provided by your plug-in.
    For some plug-in classes, this may be the only function the host calls in your plug-in
    (other than the startup and shutdown functions). For others, the activation function is
    where the host finds out about the plug-in's callback functions.</p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( int )
   MyActivate( long version, GlobalFunc *global, void *local,
      void *serverData );</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>version</tt></dt>
      <dd>A class-specific version number. As development of LightWave continues, the interaction
        between the host and a given plug-in class is sometimes redefined. This number tells you,
        among other things, what version of the local data the host has passed. </dd>
      <dt><tt>global</tt></dt>
      <dd>A function that gives your plug-in access to services provided by the host and by Global
        class plug-ins. See the pages about the <a href="globfunc.html">global</a> function and <a
        href="global.html">Global</a> plug-ins for more information.</dd>
      <dt><tt>local</tt></dt>
      <dd>Class-specific data.&nbsp; Each plug-in class receives different data through this
        argument. For many classes, this points to a structure that the plug-in needs to fill. The
        host gets pointers to other functions in your plug-in this way. For interface class
        plug-ins (the interface counterpart of handler plug-ins), this argument is a pointer to
        the handler's own instance data, which the interface allows the user to modify.</dd>
      <dt><tt>serverData</tt></dt>
      <dd>The data pointer returned by the startup function. Unless you replaced the default
        startup function, you should ignore this argument. In particular, don't try to dereference
        the pointer, since on most systems it contains an invalid (although non-NULL) address.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><a name="activatereturn">The activation function returns</a> a code that tells the host
    whether the plug-in was activated successfully.<dl>
      <dt><tt>AFUNC_BADVERSION</tt></dt>
      <dd>The version argument differs from what your plug-in supports. In some cases the host
        will try again with a lower version number.</dd>
      <dt><tt>AFUNC_BADGLOBAL</tt></dt>
      <dd>A call to the global function failed.</dd>
      <dt><tt>AFUNC_BADLOCAL</tt></dt>
      <dd>Your plug-in doesn't like something in the local data.</dd>
      <dt><tt>AFUNC_BADAPP</tt></dt>
      <dd>The host is a program you don't support.</dd>
      <dt><tt>AFUNC_OK</tt></dt>
      <dd>Return this when none of the other values is appropriate.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Startup and Shutdown</strong></p>
    <p>(If you're new to writing LightWave plug-ins, you can safely skip this part.) These two
    optional entry points allow the module to initialize itself when it is first loaded and to
    clean itself up before being unloaded.</p>
    <pre>
    void *Startup( void );
    void Shutdown( void *serverData );</pre>
    <p>Most plug-in files don't require module-level initialization and cleanup. They use the
    empty startup and shutdown functions supplied by the SDK linker library.</p>
    <p>The startup function is called when the plug-in is first loaded by the host. The return
    value is the data passed to the activation and shutdown functions as the <tt>serverData</tt>
    argument. Returning NULL from the startup function indicates failure, so even if a module
    has no real server data, it should still return something. The module's shutdown function
    is called just before the host unloads the module. Any allocated server data should be
    freed at this point.</p>
    <p><strong>Calling Convention</strong></p>
    <p>Functions in the plug-in get called directly by the host, and this is a funky thing in
    some systems since they are different environments. The XCALL_ macro takes care of
    everything for all different systems and compilers, so these can be used to make
    multi-platform servers from a single source code.</p>
    <p>XCALL_ is used on the return type, e.g. XCALL_(int) for an external entry point
    returning an int. </p>
    <p>The activation function as well as any function pointers returned from the activation
    function need the XCALL treatment. Startup and Shutdown do not. </td>
