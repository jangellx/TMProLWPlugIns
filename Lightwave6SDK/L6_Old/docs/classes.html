    </center></div><p>The following summary loosely groups the classes into a few broad
    categories. These categories are merely suggestive. They don't have any technical
    significance, and there are certainly other ways the classes can be grouped. The classes
    in the ignominious <em>Other</em> category are actually among the most interesting;
    they're categories unto themselves.</p>
    <p><em><strong>File Handling</strong></em><dl>
      <dt><a name="ImageLoader" href="classes/imgload.html">ImageLoader</a></dt>
      <dd>LightWave relies on image loader plug-ins to read image files. An image loader converts
        the image information in a file into a rectangular bitmap in one of LightWave's internal
        formats, which include 8-bit grayscale, 8-bit indexed color, 24-bit RGB, 32-bit RGBA, and
        floating point grayscale, RGB and RGBA.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ImageSaver" href="classes/imgsave.html">ImageSaver</a></dt>
      <dd>As you might guess, image savers work very much like image loaders in reverse. Loaders
        and savers employ the same protocols, and the loader and saver for a given format almost
        always share source code and reside in the same .p file.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="AnimLoaderHandler" href="classes/animload.html">AnimLoaderHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Animation loaders treat animation files (AVI, QuickTime or MPEG files, for example) as a
        sequence of still images. LightWave calls on them during rendering to retrieve one frame
        at a time from an animation file. Frames are passed to LightWave using the image loader
        protocols.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="AnimSaverHandler" href="classes/animsave.html">AnimSaverHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Animation savers write out a sequence of rendered images as an animation file. The
        rendered frames are added to the animation file as each frame is rendered. The rendered
        image is passed to the saver in the same way it's passed to <a href="#FrameBufferHandler">frame
        buffer display</a> plug-ins, except that there is no pause function call after each frame,
        and animation savers are initially given a filename. </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ObjectLoader" href="classes/objload.html">ObjectLoader</a></dt>
      <dd>Object loaders read and convert object geometry files.When Layout or Modeler encounter
        an object file in a format they don't recognize, they call the object loaders in sequence
        until one of them recognizes and loads the object. Any geometry data that LightWave's
        native object format supports can also be passed to LightWave by an object loader. <p>There
        isn't a corresponding object saver class. You can implement an object saver using the <a
        href="#MeshDataEdit">MeshDataEdit</a> class in Modeler or the mesh access globals in
        Layout.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a name="SceneConverter" href="classes/scenecvt.html">SceneConverter</a></dt>
      <dd>Scene converters are used to load foreign scene formats. When Layout encounters a scene
        file it can't load, it passes the filename to the scene converters in sequence until one
        of them recognizes the format. The converter rewrites the scene as a temporary LWSC file
        and passes the filename of the temporary file back to Layout, and after Layout loads the
        file, it calls the plug-in again to delete the temporary file. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Dialogs</strong></em><dl>
      <dt><a name="FileRequester" href="classes/freq.html">FileRequester</a></dt>
      <dd>File requester plug-ins replace the host platform's default file selection dialog, or
        provides one if none exists.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ColorPicker" href="classes/colorpik.html">ColorPicker</a></dt>
      <dd>Color picker plug-ins replace the host platform's default color selection mechanism. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Modeling</strong></em><dl>
      <dt><a name="MeshDataEdit" href="classes/me.html">MeshDataEdit</a></dt>
      <dd>Mesh editing Modeler plug-ins can examine, modify and create points and polygons.
        They're listed in the Modeler interface in the Custom pop-up under Tools.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="CommandSequence" href="classes/cs.html">CommandSequence</a></dt>
      <dd>These Modeler plug-ins can issue commands similar to the operations available to the
        user in the interface. They can also do the same mesh editing that MeshDataEdit plug-ins
        do. CommandSequence plug-ins appear in the Custom popup in the Objects menu, and the user
        has the ability to set the string arguments they receive.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ToolHandler" href="classes/tool.html">ToolHandler<br>
        CreateToolHandler<br>
        TransformToolHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Description.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Rendering</strong></em><dl>
      <dt><a name="DisplacementHandler" href="classes/displace.html">DisplacementHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Displacement plug-ins deform objects by moving their points. The evaluation function is
        called for each vertex at each time step.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ItemMotionHandler" href="classes/itemmot.html">ItemMotionHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>At each time step, item motion plug-ins can translate, rotate and scale any item that
        can be keyframed (objects, lights, cameras, bones). </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ChannelHandler" href="classes/channel.html">ChannelHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Channel handlers are similar to item motion handlers, but they work on a single keyframe
        channel, and the data they control can represent anything, not just the familiar motion
        channels. These can be used in combination with <a href="#CustomObjHandler">custom objects</a>.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ObjReplacementHandler" href="classes/objrep.html">ObjReplacementHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Object replacement plug-ins can replace the geometry of an object at each time step. The
        evaluation function replaces an object simply by returning the filename of a different
        object. This can be used to load object sequences, analogous to image sequences, or to
        manage multiple versions of an object modeled at different levels of detail.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ShaderHandler" href="classes/shader.html">ShaderHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Shaders modify the appearance of a surface during rendering. The shader evaluation
        function is called at every pixel in which the associated surface is visible, and at each
        of these surface spots, the shader can modify any or all of the surface's basic
        attributes.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ProceduralTextureHandler" href="classes/texture.html">ProceduralTextureHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Procedural textures are functions that modulate the parameters of a surface. They are
        exactly like Layout's built-in textures (fractal noise, for example), taking an arbitrary
        3D vector as input and producing another vector as output. They work at a lower level than
        shaders.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="ImageFilterHandler" href="classes/imgfilt.html">ImageFilterHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Image filter plug-ins apply image post processing (filtering) effects to the final
        rendered image. Each filter is applied after all the antialiasing and motion blur passes
        are complete. The filter has access to LightWave's internal image buffers, and it does its
        work by modifying the red, green, blue and alpha values of the final image. Image filters
        may also be called to apply their effects to a test image in a preview window. </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="PixelFilterHandler" href="classes/pxlfilt.html">PixelFilterHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Pixel filters apply image post processing effects to individual pixels (strictly
        speaking, <em>samples</em>) in the rendered image. Pixel filters have access to the same
        internal buffers as image filters, but differ from image filters because they work on one
        sample at a time, rather than the entire image, and they're called before antialiasing and
        motion blur. Pixel filters also resemble shaders, except that they work on the rendered
        image rather than a single surface.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="EnvironmentHandler" href="classes/environ.html">EnvironmentHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Environment handlers replace Layout's backdrop and fog effects. They can draw the sky
        and the horizon, for example, on the scene's infinitely distant backdrop, or attenuate and
        whiten the color of distant objects to simulate fog.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="VolumetricHandler" href="classes/volume.html">VolumetricHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Volume rendering plug-ins integrate opacity and color along rays fired through the
        scene. The rays are fired by Layout and passed one at a time to the volume renderer for
        evaluation. Volumetric rendering can be used to create smoke plumes, splashing liquids,
        x-ray views, hair, fur, feathers--anything that involves light transmission effects or
        details too fine to model with explicit geometry.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="MasterHandler" href="classes/master.html">MasterHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Master plug-ins manage complex animation effects that require the coordinated operation
        of multiple plug-in instances, or multiple plug-ins of different classes. Examples include
        surface effects that the user can apply to all surfaces simultaneously, and a physics
        engine that can control motion, deformation and volumetrics through a single interface.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Other</strong></em><dl>
      <dt><a name="FrameBufferHandler" href="classes/framebuf.html">FrameBufferHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>Frame buffer plug-ins display the rendered image as each frame is completed. They
        include a pause function to give the user time to view the image and decide whether to
        continue rendering. </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="Global" href="classes/globserv.html">Global</a></dt>
      <dd>Global plug-ins provide services that any other plug-in can use. These services are
        added to the list of services available through the <tt>GlobalFunc</tt> every plug-in
        receives in its activation function. The <a href="globals.html">globals page</a> explains
        how both built-in and plug-in Global class services are made available to other plug-ins.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="LayoutGeneric" href="classes/generic.html">LayoutGeneric</a></dt>
      <dd>Generic plug-ins are utilities that perform non-rendering tasks such as configuring
        external devices or performing calculations. Generics can also issue commands that alter
        the scene.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <a name="CustomObjHandler" href="classes/custobj.html">CustomObjHandler</a></dt>
      <dd>These can be thought of as custom null objects. The plug-in controls how the object
        looks to the user in Layout's interface and can get and set an arbitrary number of channel
        parameters.</dd>
