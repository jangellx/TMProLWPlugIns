    <h3>Compiling LightWave Plug-ins</h3>
    <p>LightWave plug-ins on all platforms are ordinary operating system objects (they're DLLs
    under Windows, for example), so building them is pretty straightforward. You'll need to
    define a couple of preprocessor symbols and export one variable name, and you'll need to
    compile and link with a bit of code supplied with the SDK. LightWave plug-ins are
    ordinarily given a &quot;.p&quot; filename extension, although this isn't required.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Preprocessor Symbols</strong></em></p>
    <p>The SDK header files rely on preprocessor symbols to identify the operating system and
    CPU of the host system. These are currently used to define system-<wbr>specific versions of the
    <tt>XCALL_</tt> macro and the <tt>HostDisplayInfo</tt> structure (don't worry if you don't
    know what those are yet), and they determine what is stored in the system identification
    fields of the module descriptor. The operating system defines are</p>
    <pre>   _WIN32   /* Microsoft Windows */
   _MACOS   /* Macintosh */
   _XGL     /* Unix */</pre>
    <p>and the CPU defines are.</p>
    <pre>   _X86_    /* Intel and Intel-compatible */
   _ALPHA_  /* Alpha AXP */
   _PPC_    /* PowerPC */
   _MIPS_   /* MIPS */</pre>
    <p>You need one symbol from the first list and one from the second, and you need to pass
    them to the compiler as preprocessor defines.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Exported Variable</strong></em></p>
    <p>The linker needs to export the symbol <tt>_mod_descrip</tt>. LightWave looks for this
    module descriptor data structure by name when it attempts to load a plug-in. Symbol export
    is handled differently in different development environments, but it's often a linker
    command line option.</p>
    <p><em><strong>SDK Library</strong></em></p>
    <p>The SDK ships with source code files defining the <tt>_mod_descrip</tt> structure,
    default <tt>Startup</tt> and <tt>Shutdown</tt> functions, and a default names array. Each
    plug-in you create must include <tt>servmain.c</tt> and must be linked with <tt>server.lib</tt>.</p>
    <p>Before compiling any plug-ins, you'll need to build <tt>server.lib</tt> for your
    system. Create a statically linked library containing <tt>servdesc.c</tt>, <tt>username.c</tt>,
    <tt>startup.c</tt>, and <tt>shutdown.c</tt>, all of which you should find in the <tt>SDK/source</tt>
    directory. Name the library <tt>server.lib</tt>. Define the operating system and CPU
    preprocessor symbols described previously when compiling the library source.</p>
    <p>You may want to create more than one version of <tt>server.lib</tt> with different
    compiler settings (debug and release versions, for instance).</p>
    <p><em><strong>Debugging Notes</strong></em></p>
    <p>Don't forget that before you can run or debug your plug-in for the first time, you need
    to add it to the plug-in list in LightWave.</p>
    <p>Quit and restart LightWave each time you rebuild your plug-in and want to run it. On
    most systems, your plug-in is cached in memory for the life of a LightWave session, so
    LightWave won't see the changes to your plug-in until it quits and restarts.</p>
    <p><strong>Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
    <p>Plug-in modules under Windows are Win32 dynamic link libraries (DLLs). You don't need
    to create an import library (.lib) or an export file (.exp) for plug-in DLLs, but you will
    need to export <tt>_mod_descrip</tt>. One way to do this is to include a module definition
    (.def) file containing an <tt>EXPORT _mod_descrip</tt> directive. You can use the default <tt>source\serv.def</tt>
    file provided with the SDK for this.</p>
    <p>Win32 DLLs have a standard entry point function named <tt>DllMain</tt>. You don't need
    to provide a <tt>DllMain</tt> for your LightWave plug-ins unless, for example, the user
    interface is built with Windows interface components that require the DLL's instance
    handle. (But consider building your interface using the platform-independent components
    provided with the plug-in SDK.)</p>
    <p>The alignment of structure members in your DLL must match LightWave's.</p>

    </center></div><p>The recipes for specific compilers discuss what, if anything, you need
    to do to ensure that your plug-in's data is properly aligned.</p>
    <p>If you decide to use makefiles to build your plug-ins, they should contain lines
    resembling the following:</p>
    <pre>   LWSDK_FLAGS = -D_X86_ -D_WIN32

   .c.obj:
      $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LWSDK_FLAGS) $*.c $(LWSDK_SRC)servmain.c

   .obj.p:
      $(LINKER) -dll -out:$@ -def:$(LWSDK_INCL)serv.def $*.obj \
       $(LWSDK_LIB)server.lib $(OTHER_LIBS)</pre>
    <p>In other words, define the symbols <tt>_X86_</tt> (or <tt>_ALPHA_</tt>) and <tt>_WIN32</tt>,
    include <tt>servmain.c</tt> in the list of source code files, include the module
    definition file <tt>serv.def</tt> so that <tt>_mod_descrip</tt> is exported, and link with
    <tt>server.lib</tt>.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Microsoft Visual C++</strong></em></p>
    <p>To build an MSVC version of the SDK library,<ul>
      <li>Create a new project workspace, or insert a new project into an existing workspace. The
        project type should be &quot;Static Library.&quot; Name the project &quot;<tt>server</tt>&quot;.</li>
      <li>Settings dialog, C/C++ tab, add <tt>_X86_</tt> (or <tt>_ALPHA_</tt>) and&nbsp; <tt>_WIN32</tt>
        to the preprocessor definitions field.</li>
      <li>In the field for additional include directories, type the path to the plug-in SDK <tt>include</tt>
        directory.</li>
      <li>Add <tt>servdesc.c</tt>, <tt>username.c</tt>, <tt>startup.c</tt>, and <tt>shutdown.c</tt>
        to the project. These are located in the <tt>SDK\source</tt> directory.</li>
      <li>Build <tt>server.lib</tt>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create a plug-in,<ul>
      <li>Create a new project workspace, or insert a new project into an existing workspace. The
        project type should be &quot;Dynamic-Link Library.&quot;</li>
      <li>Settings dialog, C/C++ tab, add <tt>_X86_</tt> (or <tt>_ALPHA_</tt>) and&nbsp; <tt>_WIN32</tt>
        to the preprocessor definitions field.</li>
      <li>In the field for additional include directories, type the path to the plug-in SDK <tt>include</tt>
        directory.</li>
      <li>Add your source files to the project. Also add <tt>servmain.c</tt>, <tt>server.lib</tt>
        and <tt>serv.def</tt>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accept the default settings for the calling convention (__cdecl), alignment (8 byte)
    and runtime library (multithreaded or multithreaded debug, for the release and debug
    versions, respectively). If you've built both debug and release versions of <tt>server.lib</tt>
    (and this is recommended), make sure you list the appropriate one for the debug and
    release versions of your plug-in.</p>
    <p>You're ready to build your plug-in. To debug it,<ul>
      <li>Settings dialog, Debug tab, enter the full path to <tt>lightwav.exe</tt> or <tt>modeler.exe</tt>,
        as appropriate, in the field labeled &quot;Executable for debug session.&quot;</li>
      <li>Set the working directory to the directory containing the LightWave executables.</li>
      <li>Build a debug version of your plug-in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hit F5 to begin debugging. The debugger will warn you that the LightWave executable
    doesn't contain any debugging information, but that's okay. Your plug-in does have this
    information, which the debugger will find as soon as your plug-in is started by LightWave.

    <p><em><strong>Watcom C++ 10.0a</strong></em></p>
    <p>(On June 30, 1999, Sybase, Inc., sent an &quot;end of life&quot; letter to registered
    owners of Watcom C/C++ announcing that version 11.0 of the compiler would be its last.
    Watcom is therefore unlikely to play a role in future LightWave plug-in development. This
    section remains useful, however, as an illustration of the incompatibilities you may
    encounter with some compilers.)</p>
    <p>In Watcom terminology, plug-ins are NT DLLs, so that should be your target type. <tt>server.lib</tt>
    should also be built as an NT object.</p>
    <p>To build a plug-in,<ul>
      <li>Add the SDK include directory to the include path [<b>-i</b>]</li>
      <li>Disable stack depth checking [<b>-s</b>]</li>
      <li>Add macro definitions [<b>-d</b>] <tt>_X86_</tt> and <tt>_WIN32</tt></li>
      <li>Change char default to signed [<b>-j</b>]</li>
      <li>Use 8-byte structure alignment [<b>-zp8</b>]</li>
      <li>Use the 32-bit flat memory model [<b>-mf</b>] (the default)</li>
      <li>Use the stack-based calling convention [<b>-5s</b>]</li>
      <li>Export [<b>exp</b>] <tt>_mod_descrip</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's an important mismatch in calling conventions that apparently can't be solved
    with a compiler switch or a pragma. When using the stack-based calling convention, which
    plug-ins must, Watcom 10.0a expects functions that return floating-point numbers to put
    them in specific registers, while LightWave's code leaves them at the top of the FPU
    stack. You'll encounter this whenever a plug-in compiled with Watcom needs to call a
    plug-in SDK function that returns a double.</p>
    <p>What happens can be illustrated with a little assembly-ish pseudocode. Given</p>
    <pre>   double routine( void );
   double result;
   result = routine();</pre>
    <p>the different ways the function call is handled are</p>
    <pre>   Microsoft:  call routine
               fstp result          ; pop ST(0) into result

   Watcom:     call routine
               mov result,   eax    ; move edx:eax into result
               mov result+4, edx</pre>
    <p>When compiled in Microsoft Visual C++, <tt>routine</tt> leaves its return value at the
    top of the FPU stack, which is popped into <tt>result</tt>. In Watcom 10.0a, <tt>routine</tt>
    leaves its return value in the register pair <tt>edx:eax</tt>, which is then <tt>mov</tt>ed
    into <tt>result</tt>.</p>
    <p>The workaround for this involves adding a bit of inline assembly language to each
    source file that contains a call to a LightWave function returning a double. At the
    beginning of each such file, put</p>
    <pre>   static double fac;      /* floating point accumulator */
   extern void sdk_fstp( void );
   #pragma aux sdk_fstp = &quot;fstp fac&quot;
   #define SDK_DBLRTN( x ) \
      sdk_fstp();          \
      x = fac;</pre>
    <p>This uses Watcom inline assembly to load the contents of ST(0) into a fixed memory
    location, from which the value can be copied. Calls that would look like this </p>
    <pre>   result = objInfo-&gt;dissolve( objID, t );</pre>
    <p>must be changed to </p>
    <pre>   objInfo-&gt;dissolve( objID, t );
   SDK_DBLRTN( result );</pre>
    <p>The SDK function is called without assigning its return value. The assembly instruction
    <tt>fstp fac</tt> is inserted after the call to retrieve the return value, then <tt>fac</tt>
    is copied into <tt>result</tt>. </p>
    <p><strong>Macintosh</strong></p>
    <p>Plug-in modules on the Mac are PowerPC shared libraries of type <tt>shlb</tt>.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Metrowerks CodeWarrior</strong></em></p>
    <p>Before compiling any plug-ins, you'll need to build a Mac version of the SDK library.<ul>
      <li>Create a new, empty project.</li>
      <li>Target Settings/Linker, choose Mac OS PPC Linker.</li>
      <li>PPC Target/Project Type, choose Library.</li>
      <li>PPC Target, name the file <tt>server.lib</tt>.</li>
      <li>PPC Processor, set alignment to PowerPC (the default).</li>
      <li>Define the <tt>_MACOS</tt> and <tt>_PPC_</tt> preprocessor symbols.</li>
      <li>Add <tt>servdesc.c</tt>, <tt>username.c</tt>, <tt>startup.c</tt>, and <tt>shutdown.c</tt>.
        These are located in the <tt>SDK/source</tt> directory.</li>
      <li>Build.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To create a plug-in project,<ul>
      <li>Create a new, empty project.</li>
      <li>Target Settings/Linker, choose Mac OS PPC Linker.</li>
      <li>PPC Target/Project Type, choose Shared Library.</li>
      <li>Define the <tt>_MACOS</tt> and <tt>_PPC_</tt> preprocessor symbols.</li>
      <li>PPC PEF/Export Symbols, choose the method you'll use to export <tt>_mod_descrip</tt>.
        See the CodeWarrior shared library documentation for an explanation of the available
        methods.</li>
      <li>Add your source code files to the project, along with <tt>servmain.c</tt>.</li>
      <li>Add <tt>server.lib</tt> and <tt>MSL Runtime-PPC.Lib</tt> to the project. If the plug-in
        calls Mac Toolbox routines, you'll also need to add <tt>InterfaceLib</tt> (but consider
        building your interface using the platform-independent components provided with the
        plug-in SDK).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Unix</strong></p>
    <p>Plug-in modules under Unix are shared object modules, or DSO files. When compiling,
    remember to define both <tt>_XGL</tt> and the preprocessor symbol for your CPU. <tt>_mod_descrip</tt>
    must be exported from the DSO, and <tt>servmain.o</tt> must be among the objects passed to
    the linker. The link line should include any other libraries that the plug-in would need
    as a stand-alone program.</p>
    <pre>   .o.p:
      ld -shared -exported_symbol _mod_descrip -L$(SDK_LIB) \
       $(SDK_LIB)servmain.o $*.o -o $@ -lserver.lib $(OTHER_LIBS)</pre>
