    <h3>ImageLoader</h3>
    <p><small><strong>Availability:</strong>&nbsp; LightWave 6.0</small><br>
    <small><strong>Component:</strong>&nbsp; Layout, Modeler</small></p>
    <p>Image loaders move still image data into LightWave, translating to LightWave's internal
    image formats from the myriad file formats available for image storage.</p>
    <p>When an image loader's activation function is called, it should open the image file and
    try to recognize its contents. This first step is important. LightWave calls all of the
    installed image loaders in sequence until one of them recognizes the file. Each image
    loader is therefore responsible for identifying the files it can load. If the file isn't
    one the loader understands, the loader sets the <tt>result</tt> field of the <tt>local</tt>
    structure to <tt>IPSTAT_NOREC</tt> and returns <tt>AFUNC_OK</tt>.</p>
    <p>If, on the other hand, the loader understands the image file, it calls <tt>local-&gt;begin</tt>
    to obtain the functions it will use to send the image data to LightWave and then calls
    those functions.</p>
    <p><strong>Activation Function</strong></p>
    <pre>   XCALL_( int ) MyImageLoader( long version, GlobalFunc *global,
      LWImageLoaderLocal *local, void *serverData );</pre>
    <p>The <tt>local</tt> argument to an image loader's activation function is an
    LWImageLoaderLocal.</p>
    <pre>   typedef struct st_LWImageLoaderLocal {
      void              *priv_data;
      int                result;
      const char        *filename;
      LWMonitor         *monitor;
      LWImageProtocolID (*begin) (void *, LWImageType);
      void              (*done)  (void *, LWImageProtocolID);
   } LWImageLoaderLocal;</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>priv_data</tt></dt>
      <dd>Pass this as the first argument to the <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>done</tt> functions. It's
        an opaque pointer to data used internally by LightWave.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>result</tt></dt>
      <dd>Set this to indicate whether the image was loaded successfully. The result codes are <dl>
          <dt><br>
            <tt>IPSTAT_OK</tt></dt>
          <dd>The image was loaded successfully.</dd>
          <dt><tt>IPSTAT_NOREC</tt></dt>
          <dd>The loader didn't recognize the file. This can happen frequently, since all loaders are
            called in sequence until one of them <em>doesn't</em> return this result.</dd>
          <dt><tt>IPSTAT_BADFILE</tt></dt>
          <dd>The loader couldn't open the file. If the loader is able to open the file but believes
            it has found an error in the contents, it should return <tt>IPSTAT_NOREC</tt>.</dd>
          <dt><tt>IPSTAT_ABORT</tt></dt>
          <dd>Use this to indicate that the user cancelled the load operation. This can happen if you
            use the monitor to indicate the progress of a lengthy image loading operation.</dd>
          <dt><tt>IPSTAT_FAILED</tt></dt>
          <dd>An error occurred during loading, for example a memory allocation failed.</dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>filename</tt></dt>
      <dd>The name of the file to load.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>monitor</tt></dt>
      <dd>A monitor for displaying the progress of the load to the user. You don't have to use
        this, but you're encouraged to if your image loading takes an unusual amount of time. This
        is the same structure returned by the global monitor call. See the global monitor page for
        details.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>begin( priv_data, pixeltype )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Call this when you're ready to begin sending image data to LightWave. This will be after
        you've opened and examined the image file and know what it contains. The pixel type code
        tells LightWave what kind of pixel data you will be sending, and this will in general
        depend on what kind of pixel data the file contains, although it doesn't have to. The type
        must be one of the types listed later in the <a href="#pixdata">Pixel Data</a> section. <p>The
        <tt>begin</tt> function returns a pointer to an LWImageProtocol, which is the structure
        you'll use to actually transfer the image data. The LWImageProtocol structure is described
        in detail below. If you call <tt>begin</tt>, you must also call <tt>done</tt> so that
        LightWave can free resources associated with the LWImageProtocol it allocates for you.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>done( priv_data, protocol )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Completes the image loading process. The protocol argument should be the
        LWImageProtocolID returned to you by <tt>begin</tt>. Only call <tt>done</tt> if you
        previously called <tt>begin</tt>. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><strong>Image Protocol</strong></p>
    <p>The LWImageProtocol structure returned by the local <tt>begin</tt> function provides
    the functions you'll call to send the image data to LightWave. The <tt>lwimageio.h</tt>
    header file defines macros that slightly simplify calls to these functions, although they
    won't be described here. Using the macros is optional.</p>
    <pre>   typedef struct st_LWImageProtocol {
      int   type;
      void *priv_data;
      int  (*done)     (void *, int);
      void (*setSize)  (void *, int w, int h);
      void (*setParam) (void *, LWImageParam, int, float);
      int  (*sendLine) (void *, int, const LWPixelID);
      void (*setMap)   (void *, int, const unsigned char[3]);
   } LWImageProtocol, *LWImageProtocolID;</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>type</tt></dt>
      <dd>LightWave sets this to the pixel type code you sent in the call to <tt>begin</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>priv_data</tt></dt>
      <dd>Pass this to the protocol functions. It's an opaque pointer to data used internally by
        LightWave.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>done( priv_data, result )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Call this when you've finished sending image data. The result should be <tt>IPSTAT_OK</tt>
        or <tt>IPSTAT_FAILED</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>setSize( priv_data, width, height )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Call this to tell LightWave the pixel dimensions of the image. The width and height are
        the number of pixels in a scanline and the number of scanlines, respectively. This must be
        called before the first call to <tt>sendLine</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>setParam( priv_data, paramid, intparam, floatparam )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Use this to tell LightWave other information about the image. The parameter ID can be
        one of the following. <dl>
          <dt><br>
            <tt>LWIMPAR_ASPECT</tt></dt>
          <dd>The pixel aspect ratio, defined as width/height. This will most often be 1.0 (the
            default), but D1 NTSC images, for example, use a pixel aspect of 0.9, meaning that each
            pixel is 0.9 times as wide as it is high. Set the value in <tt>floatparam</tt> and set <tt>intparam</tt>
            to 0.</dd>
          <dt><br>
            <tt>LWIMPAR_NUMCOLS</tt></dt>
          <dd>The size of the color table in an indexed-color image (an image of type <tt>LWIMTYP_INDEX8</tt>).
            Valid values are between 2 and 256. Set the value in <tt>intparam</tt> and set <tt>floatparam</tt>
            to 0.</dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>sendLine( priv_data, y, scanline_pixels )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Send one scanline from the image. <tt>setSize</tt> must be called before the first call
        to <tt>sendLine</tt>. Scanlines don't have to be sent in a particular order. Scanlines are
        numbered from the top of the image, starting at 0. The first data item in each scanline
        describes the leftmost pixel. The structure of the pixel data will depend on the pixel
        type you set in the local <tt>begin</tt> function. Details about specific types are below.</dd>
      <dt><br>
        <tt>setMap( priv_data, index, rgb )</tt></dt>
      <dd>Call this to set the color of an entry in the color table of an indexed-color image. You
        need to call <tt>setParam</tt> with a <tt>LWIMPAR_NUMCOLS</tt> parameter before calling <tt>setMap</tt>
        for the first time, but you may call <tt>setMap</tt> any time after that. The index
        identifies the color table entry and must be between 0 and <tt>numcolors-1</tt>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p><a name="pixdata"><strong>Pixel Data</strong></a></p>
    <p>The structure of the data in a scanline will vary, depending on the pixel type. Each
    scanline is an array of either unsigned bytes or floats. Bytes can contain any value
    between 0 and 255. The nominal range of float values is 0.0 to 1.0, but values outside
    that range may also be valid.</p>
    <p>Each pixel's data is contiguous--the scanline contains all of the channel values for
    the first pixel, followed by the values for the second, and so on. The <tt>lwimageio.h</tt>
    header file contains typedefs for some pixel types, but use of these in your code is
    currently optional.</p>
    <p>For each pixel type, the data is organized as follows. <dl>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_RGB24</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>unsigned char</tt> in <tt>RGBRGB...</tt> order. The
        corresponding typedef is <tt>LWPixelRGB24</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_GREY8</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>unsigned char</tt>, with one byte per grayscale pixel.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_INDEX8</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>unsigned char</tt>, with one byte per pixel containing
        color map indexes.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_GREYFP</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>float</tt>, with one float per pixel.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_RGBFP</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>float</tt> in <tt>RGBRGB...</tt> order. The
        corresponding typedef is <tt>LWPixelRGBFP</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_RGBA32</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>unsigned char</tt> in <tt>RGBARGBA...</tt> order and
        contains both RGB color and alpha channel values. The corresponding typedef is <tt>LWPixelRGBA32</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_RGBAFP</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>float</tt> in <tt>RGBARGBA...</tt> order and contains
        both RGB color and alpha channel values. The corresponding typedef is <tt>LWPixelRGBAFP</tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt>LWIMTYP_RGBAZFP</tt></dt>
      <dd>Each scanline is an array of <tt>float</tt> in <tt>RGBAZRGBAZ...</tt> order and contains
        RGB color, alpha, and depth channel values. The corresponding typedef is <tt>LWPixelRGBAZFP</tt>.
        The depth, or z, channel contains viewing coordinate system z coordinates, in meters.</dd>
