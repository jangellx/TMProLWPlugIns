<p>
When Layout or Modeler encounter a foreign object file which they cannot
parse, they will call an &quot;ObjectLoader&quot; class
server to import it.  All the loaders defined for the
host will be activated in sequence, and the first one to recognize the file
will load it.  The order in which loaders are called is not defined,
although it may be alphabetical by server name.
<p>
At activate, an ObjectImport structure is passed to a plug-in object loader
as its local data, and the loader should attempt to parse the input file
given by the filename field.
If it cannot open or recognize the file the loader should set the
`result' field to the appropriate code and return.
<p>
If it recognizes the file type it should send the mesh and surface data to
the host by calling the callbacks.  The `data' field is
an opaque pointer to some internal state for the host and should be the
first argument to every callback.  The `monitor' field will contain a
pointer to a monitor which can be used to track the progress of loading.
The monitor should not be used unless the object format is recognized.
<p>

<pre>
/*
 * The activation function of the server is passed an LWObjectImport
 * structure as its local data which includes the filename of the object
 * to load.  The loader attempts to parse the input file and calls the
 * embedded callbacks to insert the data into LightWave.  It indicates
 * its success or failure by setting the 'result' field, and the optional
 * failedBuf.
 *
 * result   set by the server to one of the LWOBJIM values below.
 *
 * filename the filename of the object to load.
 *
 * monitor  progress monitor that can be used to track the import
 *    process.
 *
 * failedBuf   string buffer for the server to store a human-readable
 *    error message if the result code is LWOBJIM_FAILED.
 *
 * data     private data pointer to be passed to all the embedded
 *    function callbacks.
 *
 * done     called when object import is complete.
 *
 * layer start a new layer in the import data.  The layer is
 *    qualified by an index number, a name string and a pivot
 *    point.
 *
 * point add a new point to the current layer.  The point is given
 *    by an XYZ position and the function returns a void pointer
 *    as point identifier.
 *
 * vmap     select a VMAP for assigning data to points, creating a new
 *    VMAP if it does not yet exist.  The VMAP is defined by a
 *    type, dimension and name.
 *
 * vmapVal  set a vector for a point into the currently selected VMAP.
 *    The vector should have the same dimension as the VMAP.
 *
 * polygon  add a new polygon to the current layer.  The polygon is
 *    defined by a type code, type-specific flags and a list of
 *    point identifiers.
 *
 * polTag   associate a tag string to the given polygon.  The tag
 *    string has a type, the most common being 'SURF'.
 *
 * surface  add a new surface to this object.  The surface is defined by
 *    the base name, the reference name, and a block of raw surface
 *    data.

<a name="S2.2.1"><h3>2.2.1. Sending Mesh Data</h3></a>

Sending mesh data to the host involves calling the functions provided in
the ObjectImport structure in a semi-sequential order.  The basics are
to start the data transfer, send the points, define surface names, send the
polygons, assign surface parameters to names, and complete the transfer.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Begin
<dd>Callback `begin' is called to mark the start of new mesh data.  The
second argument is for special information and should normally be null.
(It might be possible to call this more than once, although `done'
would have to be called before calling `begin' a second time.)
<dt>Points
<dd>Callback `numPoints' is called with the total number of points.  Then
`points' is called with 1 or more point coordinates until the total
number of points is reached.  Points are numbered from zero in the order
added, and that implicit index is used to create polygons.  All
points must be added before any polygons may be created.
<dt>Surfaces
<dd>The callback `surfIndex' is called with a surface name to get a surface
ID number for that surface.  This ID number is used to create polygons.
The function may optionally return a boolean flag to indicate if this
is the first time this surface name has been given an ID.
<dt>Polygons
<dd>For each polygon, the `polygon' function is called with a list of point
indices for the polygon, the number of points, mode flags and a surface
index.  The mode flags word is a collection of bits.
If the CURVE bit is set, this is a curve rather than a face.  If
the DETAIL bit is set, then this polygon is a detail of the last
top-level polygon.  If the STARTCC or ENDCC bits are set, then this curve
has start and/or end points which are continuity control points.

</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Surface Data
<dd>A block of raw surface parameters may be assigned to a name at any time
by calling the `surfData' call with the surface name and byte block.
<dt>Done
<dd>Callback `done' is called when data transfer is complete.

</dl>
If a failure occurs partway through loading a file, the loader can set
the result field and return without having to do any other cleanup.
<p>

<pre>
/*
 * The server must set the 'result' field to one of these following values
 * before it returns.
 *
 * OK    indicates successful parsing of the object file.
 *
 * BADFILE  indicates that the loader could not open the file.
 *
 * NOREC indicates that the loader could open the file but could
 *    not recognize the format.
 *
 * ABORTED  indicates the that the user manually aborted the load.
 *
 * Any other failure is indicated by the generic FAILED value.  In this case,
 * the loader may also place a human-readable error message into the buffer
 * pointed to by `failedBuf,' provided that `failedLen' is non-zero.

<a name="S2.2.3"><h3>2.2.3. Macintosh Clipboard Import</h3></a>

In Modeler on the Macintosh a special filename is employed to use object
loader plugins when pasting from the system clipboard.  If the filename
passed to the object loader is &quot;((::clipboard::))&quot;, then the loader should
look for its data in the system scrap.  This name is chosen to be impossible
(or at least extremely unlikely) as a filename on the Macintosh.
